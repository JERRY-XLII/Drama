        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So we have grown a bit and I thought it would be a good time to reiterate all of the rules and expectations (or lack there of) of posting and commenting in r/Drama. </p>

<p><a href="/r/Drama">/r/Drama</a>&#39;s main goal is to cater to off-site drama first and foremost. This means open season on anything dramatic from anywhere on the internet. The caveat with this is that Reddit drama is also welcome, as many online communities overlap with Reddit communities. Reddit drama will not be removed so long as it does not contain dox. That takes us to..</p>

<p><strong>Dox</strong>. What is and is not dox is decided solely by the admins, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/rules">you can view what they consider dox here</a>. Linking to other sites/forums is not considered dox so long as you do not <strong>link the usernames on the other forum to a specific Redditor</strong>. Do not do that. All dox will be removed immediately, and we will make a gossip post about how funny it is that you got shadowbanned. </p>

<p><strong>Moderation</strong>. Moderation here will be very loose. As long as a link isn&#39;t going to get the admins angry, and is dramatic, we will keep it up. Same goes with the comment sections. If someone says something horrible, downvote them, refute them, whatever. The mods here are <strong>not</strong> the morality police. </p>

<p><strong>Gossip</strong>. Gossip is awesome. We adore gossip. If you have some juicy gossip, feel free to post it <strong>with context</strong>. A short (or long) explanation of your gossip is required for maximum lulz. If your gossip is not true, post it anyway, that shit is hilarious. </p>

<p><strong>Lolcows</strong>. If you discover someone who is pure internet entertainment, feel free to post them here so we may rubberneck their hilarity. No dox, but news stories are free game, and non-reddit affiliated forum users are okay as long as there are no <em>real life names</em>. Facebooks/Twitters should be screenshotted and have all names removed, unless they are a celebrity. </p>

<p><strong>Brigades</strong>. Try really super hard to not brigade because it&#39;s bad mkay. </p>

<p><strong>Rumors</strong>. See Gossip. Same story.</p>

<p><strong>Other stuff</strong>. Tags, flairs, and other neato shiney shit is on it&#39;s way. </p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong> - Don&#39;t post things that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/rules">anger the admins</a> and have a lovely time. &lt;3</p>
