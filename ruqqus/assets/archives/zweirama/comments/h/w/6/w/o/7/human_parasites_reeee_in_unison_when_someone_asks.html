<p>More specifically, it would further one goal (having my own house) at the great expense of sacrificing another goal (to be comfy and not suffer wageslavery) which is more important to me than having my own house.</p>

<p>Realistically, we can&#39;t all get everything we want out of life. We have to weigh the pros and cons of what we do and choose the path that is best for us. For me, at least so far, the best path is being NEET.</p>

<p>If being able to handle things means getting and working a full-time job? Probably not. Other than that I&#39;m a very functional person. I&#39;m certainly not incapable of doing jobs either, but that doesn&#39;t mean someone would hire me, or that I wouldn&#39;t get fired for being too slow, being socially awkward, being late due to sleep issues, taking half hour restroom breaks because of IBS, having panic attacks, etc. The actual work is far less of a problem than the process of actually getting a job and then living up to the bossman&#39;s high standards.</p>

<p>What kind of emergency? I could call for help if something happened to my parents, or drive someone to a hospital/doctor. I can&#39;t imagine there being much else I could do to help someone in any emergency situation.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather not have any birthday parties. After my parents are gone I&#39;ll probably have minimal contact with anyone, and when I die my body will probably go undiscovered until the house gets foreclosed on or whatever.</p>

That&#39;s the equivalent of saying that if a person is kidnapped and held against their will, and eventually develops Stockholm syndrome and no longer attempts to escape, that there was never any kidnapping or crime committed in the first place. Taking one&#39;s own life is generally very difficult and comes with a huge risk of not dying but instead increasing one&#39;s suffering, compared to never being born which is void of both effort and risk.

    <div class="md"><p>The surprise party analogy works. A lot of people do hate surprise parties, myself included.</p>

<p>I am 100% in favor of euthanasia programs being available to people, and I would also like to see a complete abolishment of anyone being imprisoned in hospitals for &quot;being a danger to themselves&quot;, because people should be free to do what they want with their own lives as long as they&#39;re not harming anybody else.</p>

<p>While that would be a significant improvement to the situation, I would still always argue that procreation is wrong in the first place. People who never exist can&#39;t actually be &quot;denied&quot; anything because they can&#39;t miss existing if they never existed, but when people are created there will always be some who suffer greatly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes your mum totally should have asked your dad&#39;s balls and sperm for consent before she shat you out</p>

<p>antinatalism is the most manchild thinking in existence, at some point you have to take up responsibility for your own life and not keep sucking off your mum&#39;s teats when you&#39;re 30+ years old</p>

<p>The point is that consent is impossible to get, and therefore it&#39;s always immoral.</p>

<p>Or I could just... not, and keep being a NEET for the rest of my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not, but I do agree that it&#39;s wrong to breed other living creatures as well. I just don&#39;t live up to my own moral standards in this regard and I admit that.</p>

<p>I am likely autistic and suffer from extreme sensory sensitivity, including my taste buds, and it&#39;s very difficult for me to eat anything outside of a select few types of food that don&#39;t bother me. It&#39;s something I continually look to improve, but there&#39;s only so much I can do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don’t like all meats either. I generally prefer ground meats because the texture is consistent. I actually like rice but I can’t eat it any more because it sometimes gets stuck in my esophagus.</p>

<p>Also, it is possible to eat meat without going against antinatalism at all, as long as the creatures are hunted rather than bred. The mass breeding of creatures for consumption is largely a societal problem that came with overpopulation.</p>
