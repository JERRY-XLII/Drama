<p>I stepped on a nail several weeks ago while I was in Town picking up some Necessities. It hurt, but I did not think much of it at the Time. Days later I felt as though I had the Chills and my body was stiff, especially my neck. I went to the hospital. They told me I likely had something called Tetanus, I had never heard of it but supposedly I should have had a vaccination to prevent this.</p>

<p>Anyways, I have been treated with Tetanus Immune Globulin and received the vaccination. I was told I am lucky and it could have killed me. I am surprised I had not heard of Tetanus before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fam i&#39;m 12 years old, and still smarter than you, and i&#39;m from Bangladesh and live in England. I&#39;ve been brought up in London for all my life and ive only been in Bangladesh on holidays. overall i&#39;ve spent around 15 weeks there. i learned about Nazis a year ago and i&#39;m all against them. There&#39;s also a game called Call Of Duty World War 2 where you go AGAINST the Nazis and fight in the American army. do you think i&#39;m stupid and old enough (I&#39;m 12 to remind you) to be a Nazi? You people are so jarring and you don&#39;t understand the impact of games and what they mean. I&#39;ve always hated Nazis. why would you think a 12 year old gamer is a Nazi, you stupid bitch? Most of my life, I have spent gaming. This is not wasting my life and i play for fun. I am a Muslim and pray every day. I PRAY 5 TIMES A DAY AND YOU TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE AND HOW TO PRAY TO A DIFFERENT RELIGION YOU RACIST CUNT!?</p>
