<div class="comment mb-3 ml-0 op" data-depth="0" data-id="fsyrsh5">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/b_kin.html">b_kin</a> 2020-06-05</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Please please please, the oldest moderator of both <a href="/r/bikinibottomtwitter">/r/bikinibottomtwitter</a> and <a href="/r/blackpeopletwitter">/r/blackpeopletwitter</a> , <a href="/u/wsgy111">/u/wsgy111</a> , who moderates over 50 subreddits, <em>moderates and actively posts in <a href="/r/wsgy">/r/wsgy</a> a hate subreddit which calls for genocide against the Jews virtually every week</em></p>

<p>Reddit‚Äôs problems run deep and spill everywhere, but everyday that he is still a moderator, he is able to link his subreddit for Nazi‚Äôs into all the most popular front-page communities. </p>

<p>Then as moderator in those communities, he can guarantee their comments are well received and get many highly upvoted by attracting people from other subreddits, and banning anyone with a comment that logically critiques the racism and illogical and hateful rhetoric he brings with him. Then he can mute them so the other moderators aren‚Äôt alerted. </p>

<p><a href="/r/wsgy">/r/wsgy</a> buries it‚Äôs hate under a thin level of grifting memes, but just scroll for a minute and read some comments. I have had trouble sleeping since I realized people as evil as they are have so much control over discussion across the entire website </p>

<h1><a href="/u/wsgy111">/u/wsgy111</a>  is the most dangerous Nazi on Reddit that anyone reading this is likely currently aware of and does not believe black lives matter, all while he still dominates communities across the site</h1>

<p>Edit: I messaged about half <a href="/r/blackpeopletwitter">/r/blackpeopletwitter</a> ‚Äòs and got no response. If this upsets you, or something you see posted in his feed or on his subreddit does, please send a link to <a href="/r/blackpeopletwitter">/r/blackpeopletwitter</a> modmail and at least one random moderator. Something needs to be done. No one knows what, so we all must try everything.</p>

<p>Edit 2: and report all targeted harassment to the admins!!! Every day they don‚Äôt act on our reports is another day we know they haven‚Äôt changed anything.</p>

<p>Edit 3: I stumbled upon this by COMPLETE accident. I have no understanding of what other powermods might be in similar boats, and with what communities, but that is what Reddit needs to take action on before they can even respond to the community protests (which they need to do)</p>

<p>Edit 4: link to racism in the subreddit <a href="/u/wsgy111">/u/wsgy111</a> moderates: </p>

<p>Edit 5: here‚Äôs the oldest-moderator of BPT himself, <a href="/u/wsgy111">/u/wsgy111</a> saying he hates Jews:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wsgy/comments/gtbuso/i_hate_jews_especially_this_one_with_her_fat/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf">https://www.reddit.com/r/wsgy/comments/gtbuso/i_hate_jews_especially_this_one_with_her_fat/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>

<p>Edit 6: <a href="/u/wsgy111">/u/wsgy111</a> thinks it‚Äôs amazing how many black people are dying from coronavirus:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wsgy/comments/g82ik5/the_obesity_epidemic_is_ravaging_our_country/fonwerh/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf">https://www.reddit.com/r/wsgy/comments/g82ik5/the_obesity_epidemic_is_ravaging_our_country/fonwerh/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>

<p>Edit: after dozens of comments defending this as trolling, or not even defending it but saying my argument is invalid because I had an emotion about it, or saying it‚Äôs just the internet so it is not serious or it should be ignored, I must seek wisdom from Sartre, as I so often do in this time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúNever believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.‚Äù</p>
