<p>Well you see, people in small towns in flyover states hate intellectuals. It reminds them of how insignificant they are. Sure, they could go to school and learn but then they may have to leave their small town and be around brown people.</p>

<p>Being endorsed by the KKK is probably better than being endorsed by intellectuals to these people.</p>

<p>People in small towns hate smug assholes who refer to them as &quot;insignificant.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, thanks to the electoral college their vote actually counts more, and you&#39;d rather insult them than listen to them and court their vote.</p>

<p>Also rednecks are some of the most helpful sincere people I&#39;ve met, their communities are far more integrated than you can imagine. The Northern blue state I currently live in has embarrassingly high education disparities and race related protests because of unaddressed and heinous systemic rascism veneered with a wash of white liberalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>imagine typing even a fraction of this 😬:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come on ya willful ignorant Dems, do it, give me all those downvotes like the good little crybaby’s I think you are!/s Seriously, I’m expecting em. Come on.</p>

<p>Richard Spencer, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and organizer of the infamous 2017 Charlottesville riots, announced yesterday on Twitter that he will be voting for Joe Biden in the upcoming 2020 election.</p>

<p>A Twitter user asked Spencer if he will be voting for Biden or sitting out the election, given his belief that “Biden/Kamala will be tougher on crime/BLM than Trump.” Spencer responded, “I plan to vote for Biden and a straight democratic ticket. It’s not based on ‘accelerationism’ or anything like that”</p>

<p>Imma address every thing you people like to bring up: Bunker Bitch? Biden was hiding in his basement for how long? No one heard from him for like 3 months after covid hit America! Hell he recently made a comment about that, I mean. The history is long here, Joe Biden said that 7-Elevens were dominated by those with Indian accents. Barack Obama was the first articulate black man to run for president. This election cycle, he told blacks who are unsure about voting for him that they aren’t really black, said you can’t blame China for COVID because all Asians look alike, and said that George Floyd’s death has had a bigger impact on the world than Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination.</p>

<p>To top it all off, he joked about getting shot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the site of a recent officer-involved shooting where a black man was left paralyzed from the waist down. Yes, it sparked days of rioting as well.</p>

<p>And now, Joe says that we, as a nation, see that the reason we can remain hunkered down at home is because…of those blacks who restock the shelves in grocery stores.</p>

<p>“The American public, the blinders have been taken off…They&#39;re saying, &#39;Jeez, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf.”</p>

<p>What next? Trump was accused of rape and blah and blah, Biden wasn’t? At least Trump took his seriously.</p>

<p>The Biden Accusations</p>

<p>Biden isn’t Racist like Trump? Is that next? Huh:</p>

<p>Joe Biden’s racism is a video: 47 Years of Joe Biden&#39;s Racist Comments (Original)</p>

<p>Joe Biden made waves by suggesting people were able to quarantine during the coronavirus crisis because &quot;some Black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf,&quot; but it was hardly the first time the 77-year-old has come under criticism for a racially charged remark.</p>

<p>They&#39;re saying, &#39;Jeez, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some Black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf,&#39;&quot; Biden is heard saying in the clip.</p>

<p>May 2020: “You ain’t black.” </p>

<p>In an interview with “The Breakfast Club,” the presumptive Democratic nominee told host Charlamagne tha God, “I tell you if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,”.</p>

<p>August 2019: “Poor kids” just as bright as “white kids” </p>

<p>At a campaign event in Iowa, Biden told supporters “poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids.” He quickly corrected himself after some applause by adding: “Wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids.”</p>

<p>June 2019: “The kid wearing a hoodie.”</p>

<p>While discussing the need for criminal justice reform at a luncheon last year, Biden said people must continue to work to recognize black as equals so that African American mothers, like the mother of Trayvon Martin who was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012, no longer have to fear their sons will be shot when they go outside.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ve got to recognize that the kid wearing a hoodie may very well be the next poet laureate and not a gangbanger,&quot; Biden said.</p>

<p>June 2019: Biden touts his work with segregationist senators  Biden was slammed by fellow Democrats after invoking his ability decades ago to work with two segregationist southern senators to “get things done.” Biden brought up the names of Sens. Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia while speaking at a fundraiser Tuesday in New York City. Eastland and Talmadge, two senior members in the Senate when Biden arrived in the chamber in 1973, were firmly opposed to desegregation efforts. “I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland,” Biden said as he briefly imitated the late senator’s southern drawl. “He never called me boy. He always called me son.”</p>

<p>February 2007: Obama is &quot;the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean” -Jesse Jackson ran for president in 1984 and 1998. Alan Keyes ran for president in 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2008. Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton both ran in 2004. Perhaps they weren’t articulate or clean enough for Biden’s standards.-</p>

<p>Biden, while running for the 2008 presidency, issued what he thought was praise of then-Senator Barack Obama, saying he was &quot;the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.&quot;</p>

<p>Shylock “That’s one of the things that he finds was most in need when he was over there in Iraq for a year,” Biden said during remarks at the 40th anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation. “That people would come to him and talk about what was happening to them at home in terms of foreclosures, in terms of bad loans that were being … I mean these Shylocks who took advantage of, um, these women and men while overseas.”</p>

<p>2006: &quot;You can&#39;t go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent&quot; </p>

<p>Biden, then a senator of Delaware, can be seen in a clip talking to a man who appears to be of Indian descent. “In Delaware the largest growth in population is Indian Americans,” Biden said. “You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I’m not joking.”</p>

<p>“What President Trump has done in his spreading of racist – the way he deals with people based on the color of their skin, their national origin, where they’re from – is absolutely sickening,” said Joe Biden earlier this week. “No sitting president has ever done this. Never, never, never. No Republican president has done this. No Democratic president. We’ve had racists, and they’ve existed, they’ve tried to get elected president. He’s the first one that has.” -Biden has a decades-long record of opposition to busing and desegregation. And in 1977, during a congressional hearing on anti-busing legislation, Biden, who joined with segregationists in this fight, said he wanted to “ensure we do have orderly integration of society,” and pointed out he was “not just talking about education but all of society.” Then he said, “Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point. We have got to make some move on this.”-</p>

<p>His reason we can’t hold China accountable for COVID-19 (July 2020) This example comes from Wednesday night, when Biden explained during a virtual campaign event that Trump is wrong to hold China accountable for the COVID-19 because Americans aren’t able to distinguish “between a South Korean and someone from Beijing.”</p>

<p>What are you gonna recycle from Vox or CNN next? Trump has never disavowed white supremacy? Huh... Trump disavows white supremacy:</p>

<p>Trump rejected Duke’s support in interviews on Good Morning America and Morning Joe, calling him a &quot;bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years.&quot; In 1991, CNN’s Larry King asked Trump what Duke’s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented.</p>

<p>On Camera:</p>

<p>More?</p>

<p>While many have jumped on the “Trump is a racist” bandwagon, with no evidence exists to prove that he is one. Accusations of racism against Trump became fashionable once he started publicly criticizing Barack Obama, and when he decided to run for president as a Republican. Prior to his entrance into politics, Trump had a record of service in the private sector that quite clearly contradicts allegations of racism. In 1986, he was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, along with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali, which is awarded annually in celebration of “patriotism, tolerance, brotherhood and diversity.” At a Rainbow Push Coalition event in 1999, Jesse Jackson praised Donald Trump as a “friend” who embraced “the under-served communities.”</p>

<p>What’s next on the liberal false narrative now? Trump is Racist? Or Trump hasn’t done anything for minorities?? Huh, let’s look at those. Here’s a former Democrat about Trump and African Americans</p>

<p>Where was Was Biden during the 1994 Crime Bill Act!? He drafted the bill, That then President Bill Clinton signed into law! Yeah! I know, these damn Democrats are sneaky. (Real Racism is silent you know.) of course not you probably think racism is anything that disagrees with you right? Just like fascism! and Harris!? Don’t even get me started! Lmao I’m about actions, not words refer to this: What are some of his accomplishments? Notice how many actually benefit minorities in this country!? Not to mention how good Trumps economy is for minorities.. Let’s not, get into that..</p>
