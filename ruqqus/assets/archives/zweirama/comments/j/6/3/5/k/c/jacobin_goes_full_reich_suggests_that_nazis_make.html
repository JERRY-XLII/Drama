    <div class="md"><p>Bosses use the possibility of workers losing their ability to pay for the basic necessities of life like food, shelter, and health care to force workers to do what they want. But we can’t use such threats against workers as a way to fight racism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend who was a member of the Communist Party in my country. He took me to one of their party buildings once, and it was full of hipster moids and upper-middle class foids wearing full makeup and high heels. They tried to reel me in a bit, and then had a debate about how they must reach out to the working class and organize them.</p>

<p>A few years after that I started working for a shipping company, it was an extremely shitty job but I needed the money. The people I met while working there were the filthiest degenerates I&#39;ve ever met. Their political takes would make /pol/tards look like peace loving hippies. There was one guy that was half-retarded and crippled, and he constantly ranted about how he wanted to rape the HR girls, the security girl, and even the manager&#39;s cat. They constantly snitched on each other for the smallest mistake to suck up to the manager. I heard one guy got stabbed to death over a disagreement a couple months before I started working. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s my hot centrist take: Socialism/Communism can never work because socialists and communists are a bunch of spoilt pussies, and the working class are literally subhuman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ackchually the OG commies knew about those guys</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term lumpenproletariat refers – primarily in Marxist theory – to the underclass devoid of class consciousness. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels coined the word in the 1840s and used it to refer to the unthinking lower strata of society exploited by reactionary and counter-revolutionary forces, particularly in the context of the revolutions of 1848. They dismissed the revolutionary potential of the lumpenproletariat and contrasted it with the proletariat.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>For many German socialists in the imperial period the lumpenproletariat—especially prostitutes and pimps—was not only a &quot;political-moral problem, but also an objective, biological danger to the health of society.&quot; Karl Kautsky argued in 1890 that it is the lumpenproletariat and not the &quot;militant industrial proletariat&quot; that mostly suffer from alcoholism. August Bebel, pre-World War I leader of the SPD, linked anti-Semitic proletarians to the lumpenproletariat as the former failed to develop class consciousness, which led to a racial, and not social, explanation of economic inequality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course that kind of talk would get you cancelled in most modern socialist groups</p>
