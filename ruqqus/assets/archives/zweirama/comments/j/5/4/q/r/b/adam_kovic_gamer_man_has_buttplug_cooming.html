    <div class="md"><p>Oh he&#39;s sticking tons of stuff.</p>

<p>3 different Dildos With and without his own cum on them. Sucking after blowing out his ass.</p>

<p>Like 4 different buttplugs</p>

<p>Playing both in the office, in public and at home with creepshots of his wife. </p>

<p>The googledrive link was on /v/ and man it&#39;s some bad shit. If the &quot;Girl&quot; he sent it too had been of age he may have avoided trouble but now she&#39;s underage and he was doing it at work/public and sending pics of his wife</p>

<p>Ryan Haywood is also implicated with a different possible underage girl telling her to send pics of her playing with herself for him to enjoy. </p>

<p>Basically Roosterteeth is full of male Femenists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence that it was an underage girl Adam sent stuff to. The other Roosterteeth employee Ryan Haywood DID start an affair with a girl when she was 17. He never mangaed to have sex with her at that age and she also lied about her age to him. That of course still doesn&#39;t make it ok.</p>

<p>But since both leaks happened at the same time the stories gets mixed up and the leak that brought the attention happened on 4chan, with people there purposefully wanting to implicate Adam as a pedo. Because they think Roosterteeth and Funhaus are too liberal.</p>

<p>It is debatable wheter the pictures with Adams wife are creepshots (I highly doubt it), but for now it appears that they were shared without her consent at the very least, which is not only illegal but also a real shit thing to do to someone you supposedly love. A bunch of the photos he took are also from his owrkplace which is a big no no and reason enough to get fired in any job. </p>

<p>But all other current and former Funhaus member have also unfollowed him and Rahul Kohli denounced Adam in no uncertain terms, but also said it was NOT because of the leak. That makes it seem there may be other problems between Adam and the rest of Funhaus.</p>

And how lowly and sad must you be to take pleasure in another person’s pain and at the expense of others? Also, are you okay?

    <div class="md"><p>That’s kind of a shallow reduction of someone’s interests isn’t it? There’s a lot of reasons to watch someone play a game - general skill, game knowledge, speed runs, personality. Personally I’m partial to more comedy-centric game content. I also like the more analytical stuff, ya know, shit that dives into mechanics and game design. That’s just me.</p>
