<p>Who&#39;s father gave who 400,000,000. Holy crap so many people are so ignorant and stupid. Trump turned 1 million into billions. Out of maintaining and starting hundreds and thousands of business ya he lost a few. Very very uneducated and ignorant people in this website. Most of it is here and black people Twitter which is god awful. Dont believe everything you read, 75 percent of the things I see posted here are so false, maybe you should make it a rule to only post true things. Then again, your sub would be a waste then as a result. So I kind of see why theres no many lying bigots. Ohh well they gotta be somewhere on reddit, its really wonderful how ur all together in one scummy place, makes it so much easier for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I can be, I hate stupid people and like to make fun of them. I know I am right, so why not? It is fun to write at times, where else can you vent without repercussion when you aren&#39;t anonymous? Can&#39;t do it at work, or with friends and family. I am accelerationist and have high anxiety, I see things for how they are headed in the near future. If you aren&#39;t scared you are stupid. Nothing matters, only the people who are loud and unafraid to see things how they are will have a chance at a happy future. The world is changing quickly and you need to catch the right wave. Right now the wave is going towards a socialist/ marxist ideology. I don&#39;t agree with all of it, but most of those who find success will be a part of that movement. I work in tech so that is even more true for me.</p>

<p>Conservatives are laughably stupid and regressive. Their only methods to retain the power they have is with violence and  fascism. If you aren&#39;t part of the left soon you will rightfully be left behind. Good luck with your manufacturing or farming job... I am sure that will go well for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not angry, none of this affects me. I just enjoy. Confrontation and drama. Keep things exciting, I like to make bets and predictions about where things are headed. It is fun to see people get angry though, I don&#39;t give a fuck about civility or their feelings though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t even watch the news stupid, I read philosophy and history books and can follow my own thoughts and opinions. Anyone with half a brain wouldn&#39;t be supporting that failed nazi autocrat billionaire inpersonator Donald Trump. It is ridiculous that you think you are taking the moral or logical high road. If that is what keeps you going... I don&#39;t know what to tell you. You are simply stupid and ignorant, your judgment is flawed and your morals are corrupt. Like I said you are damaged and stupid. The world would be better without you. Go inject bleach. Stupid.</p>

<p>P.S: I am completely sober, no drugs, meds or alchohol for 6 months. These thoughts are my own studied opinions. I am not a Marxist and I am not a Democrat, I simply know stupidity and hate when I see it. I don&#39;t sugar coat things, everything I have said I really believe. You are disgusting, I have no respect for someone that holds your views. I have sympathy and respect for the planet, something you will never have. You are an ignorant plague rat that holds our society back from the progress we deserve. You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>

<p>dude redditers lmao</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stupid gimp, it is better to be mentally ill than support a Nazi president. Everything you say is stupid, willfully ignorant losers get no respect from me. They are lower than the mentally ill. Most of you would go to hell by your own standards, following an anti-Christ used car salesman, how stupid can you be man? How long have you been listening to Alex Jones and fox news? How long have you been licking boots? Were you born this stupid or did years of shitty education and propoganda lead you to such a sad and destructive existence? You disgust me, and everything about your ideology disgust me. The world would be better without you in it. Go inject some bleach and do us all a favor please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just downvoted your comment.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>What does this mean?</h2>

<p>The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.</p>

<h2>Why did you do this?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rudeness towards other Redditors,</li>
<li>Spreading incorrect information,</li>
<li>Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a <code>/s</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Am I banned from the Reddit?</h2>

<p>No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.</p>

<h2>I don&#39;t believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?</h2>

<p>Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</p>

<h2>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</h2>

<p>Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a righ</p>
