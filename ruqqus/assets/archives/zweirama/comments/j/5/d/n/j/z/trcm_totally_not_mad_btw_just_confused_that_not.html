<p>Yes, Trump supporters absolutely are a fucking joke.</p>

<p>Like, give me a fucking break dude. Every time Trump says something vile, he&#39;s &quot;just joking&quot; or &quot;being sarcastic.&quot; Every time his supporters get caught on their knees with their mouths open waiting for him to stuff his semi-erect, wrinkled old penis down their sycophantic little throats, they&#39;re &quot;just joking&quot; or &quot;owning the libs.&quot;</p>

<p>This is another in a line of thousands of memes making this guy out to be some prime physical specimen. It&#39;s the same delusion that calls him a successful businessmen despite objectively verifiable and documented evidence that his entire life has been one massive fucking failure after another.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 28 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>
