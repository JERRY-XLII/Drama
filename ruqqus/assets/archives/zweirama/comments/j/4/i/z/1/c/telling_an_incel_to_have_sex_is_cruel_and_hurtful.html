    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s enough food in Africa for everyone but only some people get it. Some people can afford to eat 10 meals a day some get one meal, sometimes nothing.

If a kid in africa had a banana tree but didnt use it it would be comparable to incels because then it would be their fault for not using it.

    <div class="md"><p>lol. Here are some facts.  Short men marry less, later and when they do they marry women of a lower socioeconomic status (sugardadd/betatbuxx), They are also more likely to be virgins, have fewer sex partners and sexual encounters as well as commiting suicide more often. Ugly men are less likely to get married than ugly women. Women rate 80% of men as being below average and only about 7% as attractive. Women have strong racial preference for white men</p>

<p>I guess short, ugly, non white men are &quot; fucking dumb and have a shitty fucking attitude.&quot;</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 4 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 28 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>
