    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So I have met and fallen in love with a great, intelligent, <strong>introverted sociopath (confirmed diagnosis).</strong> He says he loves me, he‚Äôs respected my boundaries so far and he has warned me that he has been verbally but not physically <strong>abusive to other exes.</strong> Took him awhile but <strong>I got him to admit</strong> that they weren‚Äôt crazy and that he probably played a bit of a role in their falling outs and that it‚Äôs okay.</p>

<p>First a bit about me: I would consider myself an empath. Compassion overwhelms me. I spend most of my time doing charity work. I actively work on developing my logical side but I am emotionally driven by nature. <strong>Studying to become a psychologist.</strong> I have had a rough go at life and have been isolated at points due to illness and other events that no one can relate to really. I for some reason feel very attracted to rather unemotional people generally, or folks who maybe see the world for what it is and aren‚Äôt optimistic about people and their intentions.</p>

<p><strong>I know these may be like red flags</strong> but I feel safe with him. I feel like he maybe doesn‚Äôt love me like a neurotypical would but I really don‚Äôt think he is pulling the wool over my eyes. </p>

<p>We really sit around and talk about life for hours on end. Sometimes 5-6 hours of talking and he‚Äôs majorly introverted so I know I do engage him mentally. He does struggle with alcoholism and is in treatment for it. I am a recovered alcoholic. Both in our mid twenties.</p>

<p>How can I teach him to support me as a neurotypical?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine unironically writing all this and considering urself neurotypical. Lmao hun ur a histrionic BPD codependent mess and u seem real keen to wear ur lovers mental disorders as a badge of pride. Where is ur self-respect?</p>
