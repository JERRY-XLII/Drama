<p>Because then we&#39;d all starve silly. Someone has to work to keep your fat parasitic ass from getting smoked, carved into slices, and eaten by your hungry neighbors. Conversely, we could adopt the Soviet method of rounding up leeches and enemies of the proletariat (that&#39;s you in this scenario) and working them to death on Siberian potato farms.</p>

<p>Now, he technically IS a leech.  He built his wealth on his employees.  How the fuck is that not being a leech?  Does he help other people earn billions or even millions?  Nope, he just pays out wages that arguably do not even provide a comfortable living wage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unproductivity has little do with it.  All human beings should have access to the economy regardless (through a passive income)  whether or not they work, for these reasons.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Everything you do is work.</li>
<li>A lot of what you do intersects with paid jobs.</li>
<li>Living in a society limits your freedoms by default.</li>
<li>We are all interconnected.</li>
</ol>

<p>Who says it&#39;s all about production of value?  It&#39;s also about consumption.  Capitalism is about consumption too.  Why can&#39;t I have a monthly stipend from the government?  I can guarantee you there is a 100% chance that there exists products that I either have no awareness about, or <em>passed up on because of a lack of money.</em>  Money should not be seen as a tool where one must work to receive only.  It could act as &quot;voting power&quot; when it comes to products too.  There&#39;s more to the economy than you&#39;re stupid outlook that &quot;he no work -&gt; he is loser leech -&gt; kill him!!!&quot;</p>

<p>If you think everything is perfect, what if you die before you are 60 years old?  It&#39;s certainly a possibility.  Then you wouldn&#39;t be able to experience any of the benefits of old age social security, which is technically a UBI for old folks.  Isn&#39;t that stupid?  </p>

<p>Focusing on my 3rd point, I&#39;ll tell you this: </p>

<p>Your freedom is artificially limited for living in a society, but many people do not realize this.  You cannot do anything you want or you may face consequences.  If someone&#39;s access to money is being blocked since he cannot find any work that society offers, this individual will have no choice but to be a beggar or in extreme cases hunt and gather for food in primitive ways within the society he is living in.  However, these types of behaviors would be unacceptable for society, thus there must be compensation for it by means of a regular monthly payment to everyone.  The current society we live in already does have some sort of a basic income to an extent, but it is means tested, and therefore authoritarian to a certain degree.  It is called welfare, which should be abolished.</p>

<p>Regarding my 1st point, that should be very clear.  Everything we do is work.  My second point, hey, you and I are writing messages on this fucking thread, while there are bloggers who write articles and get paid for doing that, don&#39;t they?  Can&#39;t you see everyone has inherent value and shouldn&#39;t be blocked from the economy even if they don&#39;t work?  It is just about doing artificial work?  Why do you insist on the only way for people to have money is through a wage?  Why can&#39;t we distribute money in other ways?  It will be a light burden on those who pay for it, and those who are thrown out of the economy probably could have never contributed to it in the first place, due to various issues like mental illness or lack of work experience, or some other form of disability.  </p>

<p>Also, there are other issues that have little do with productivity.  We live in a capitalist society where you can make money with money, right?  Why don&#39;t I have the opportunity to do that at an early age while some rich guy&#39;s kid has a trust fund set up for him at age 18?  He technically has a UBI (or an ABI, advanced basic income), while I get shit.  </p>

<p>As for my 4th point, we are all interconnected as a society.  We all need each other to cooperate.  The rich need the very poor to not be rebellious to a certain degree, so their minimum needs need to be met somehow, currently through welfare.  Also, teachers need students too.  It&#39;s not just a one-way street.  Your teacher gets a salary only because there are a bunch of students who go to school.  Same thing for health care.  Patients need doctors, and doctors need patients.  Why cripple people and make them struggle with money, especially in the age of information.  Literally makes zero sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, other comment was unnecessarily rude and not at all condusive to discussion. It seems like you&#39;ve put a lot of thought into this, and I appreciate you taking the time to share it, but I legitimately don&#39;t understand why you shouldn&#39;t be covered into a renewable fuel source for a public vehicle. </p>

<p>The best way to participate in the economy is to get a job, build wealth, and spend money. That&#39;s literally what makes the economy work. The way I see it, if you don&#39;t want to do that then you should participate in the economy by powering transportation for people who participate in the economy through more traditional means. I don&#39;t know why you wouldn&#39;t be on board with this. You don&#39;t have to get a job, you don&#39;t have to ever worry about feeding, housing, or entertaining yourself, and you still get your wish to participate as a valued part of society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually think Yang was on point. UBI is a good idea. I liked how it was actually universal. It appealed to my sense of fairness. Everybody got a check. $1000 a month would let a poor person buy food, me buy booze and Bezos buys a half of a hit of adrenochrome.</p>

<p>Most of Yang&#39;s other policies were decent too. Even on the stuff that I didn&#39;t totally agree with I was like &quot;At least this adorable little dude is trying to come up with a plan. That&#39;s way more than I can say for anyone else.&quot; I would have voted for him unironically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Yang permanently fucked his chances of ever being taken seriously when he stated <a href="https://youtu.be/fVQdhFoLxkM">playing into the r-slurred meme stuff for his followers.</a> However, I give him a lot of credit for being the only presidential candidate this time around who made any effort to look ahead. Automation could be a worse disaster than social media has been, and UBI is at least a halfway-interesting attempt to plan for it.</p>

<p>He came to the table with a list of 100 policies that were mostly all just common sense. If one president could get half of that list done in a term they would be killing it. Abolish the penny? It&#39;s a no-brainer.</p>

We just saw with the covid unemployment that if you offer people more money to stay at home than to go to work then they will gladly accept the offer.
