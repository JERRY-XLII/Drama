<p>I hope the human species never goes to mars in any fucking aspect because we have already fucked up this planet we don&#39;t deserve the right to fuck up any more planets.</p>

<p>Could you just imagine the eyes light up of mining corps if it was found out that mars had thousands of miles of diamond veins just meters under the ground.</p>

<p>No thanks we screwed this planet we die on this planet and let the next evolution of intelligent life see if they can fix our mistakes without repeating them because we sure ain&#39;t learnt fuck all from history.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 5 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

Most swear words used on reddit are for emphatic swearing, basically swearing to emphasize the fucking point. Because Reddit is not a serious environment, this is the place to express yourself, to express your views and opinions  with everyone, and a place of fun and relaxed discussion, this is not a fucking school, nor is it a fucking business meeting, you fucking brainless spineless motherfucking snowflakey cuntfucker. Even if there was an argument, budging in to spam it is never going to help anything, it just makes the argument worse and the hate directed to you, you even spam on therapy subreddits and trauma subs for fucks sake, I made this bot out of nothing but pure hatred and annoyance of you, who gave you the right to dictate what I can say? Why does it matter to you to constantly harass and annoy others purely based on your snowflake judgements? Why do you not delete yourself?
