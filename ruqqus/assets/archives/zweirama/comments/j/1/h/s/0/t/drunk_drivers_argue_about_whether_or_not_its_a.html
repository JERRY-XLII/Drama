<p>There is a house on my street (a HMO). An Indivdual gets in his car, turns on the Engine. He usually drinks quite a few cans of lager. He sometimes goes around the block then parks. This has been going on for sometime, generally everyday. Not sure what to do, the person also smokes and drops cigarette butts on the street. If anyone can advise?</p>

<p>just slash his tires dude dont be a pussy</p>

<p>Yeah - get a life and watch TV rather than spying on your neighbours. If there really is a problem, phone 111 and the council litter team and report it.</p>

<p>lmao &quot;litter team&quot;, i wonder if they clean it up for free?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a fucking busybody. All the nuance of these situations has been flushed down the toilet with propaganda campaigns long ago. There is a big difference between having a couple of lagers and driving around the block to smoke some cigarettes and being fall-down-pass-out-on-the-autobahn drunk. If I were only drinking lagers it would take me at least a dozen before I was too drunk to drive and I still wouldn&#39;t be running over any kids like all these idiots texting on their phones. Also if you are letting your toddler play in the street at midnight then that&#39;s on you.</p>

<p>OP if your neighbour is risking the lives of every pedestrian on your street by getting behind the wheel drunk, report it to the police as soon as possible. What happens if he does it again and this time a child runs out in front of his car? If I hadn&#39;t have been caught I would have kept doing it because I believed I was genuinely good at it. It&#39;s disappointing to see irresponsible responses like that on a forum that should be made up of users who have learned their lesson.</p>

<p>&gt; <em>Do not though stones in glass houses and do not preach to me grice. You drunk and drove and got caught pal quite simple. A grass is a grass in my book and i have no time for that</em>8</p>

<p>At least I have a shred of self awareness. Did the big bad system take your licence off you for abusing drink and now it&#39;s everyone&#39;s fault but your own?</p>

<p>Let me tell you about grassing, I live in an area in Northern Ireland where touting gets you shot by paramilitaries. If the information you have saves an innocent persons life you have a moral obligation to share it. Going by what you&#39;ve just told me, if you had information that your neighbour was abusing children, you would not tell the police as a grass is a grass? Again, we are all supposed to learn from our mistakes, and here you are proclaiming with your whole chest that you were dense enough to learn nothing after being revoked.</p>

<p>nice to see people having the same immature flamewar arguments like these in other forums besides reddit too</p>
