<p>So the ideal LTR is a girl just starting college, still living with her parents, no stable job, possibly no car, no idea what to do with her life or how.

<p>I really wish I knew where all these turbo whores are that redpill retards are so sure exist. Honestly I think this is the best proof possible that these idiots don&#39;t interact with literally anyone, male or female, outside of the internet. I mean seriously, have you every heard of anyone in real life even close to having that much random sex? Even going full six degrees of kevin bacon on your entire social circle?</p>

<p>Even my most ridiculously whorish friends in college made it to 27 having fucked like, 40 guys at the absolute extreme end of things, and that included 2 years of her being a black out drunk who&#39;d fuck anything while she was on a bender. Someone who was literally trying to piss off her super catholic family didn&#39;t even make it to the halfway mark.</p>

<p>Assuming the average woman started having sex the day she turned 16, to have had sex with 100 guys by the time she turned 27 she&#39;d have had to have been averaging a new guy every month <em>for a decade</em>. Which includes 2-4 years where she still lived with her parents. And this tard is out here saying hundreds with an &quot;s&quot;. I don&#39;t even think pornstars have fucked 200 guys by the time they&#39;re 27.</p>
