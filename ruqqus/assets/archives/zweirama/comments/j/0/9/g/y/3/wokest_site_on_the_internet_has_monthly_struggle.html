        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A news post on Metafilter discusses the removal of slurs from Scrabble tournament play. A former janny chimes in on why a formal removal was necessary: &quot;I think a lot of the people who are really good at Scrabble are people who are super analytical and mathy and have a bit of a beep-boop approach to other people.&quot;</p>

<p>This leads a spergout about how <a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/25661/Beep-Boop-Is-A-Slur-Too#1376894">beep boop is a slur too</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/25661/Beep-Boop-Is-A-Slur-Too#1376760">I do think we should avoid language comparing neuroatypical people to robots, even if we also use such language to describe ourselves, as Jessamyn does, because such language has been and is used to hurt, insult, and bully people, and it is not always clear from context whether such language is intended sympathetically or hurtfully.</a></p>

<p>More ire when said janny mentions she has <em>gasp</em> used slurs during private scrabble games:</p>

<p><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/25661/Beep-Boop-Is-A-Slur-Too#1376856">Personally, I am saddened that a mefi mod admitted to playing slurs that don&#39;t apply to them. I expected better.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/25661/Beep-Boop-Is-A-Slur-Too#1376868">For truth. It does reveal exactly why we’ve had such a hellacious time getting any traction on POC issues here. I’ve been holding on, but frankly, this has been on my mind since those comments were made and left entirely unchallenged in the thread. And then having a MeTa about that thread that addressed “beep boop” rather than the same mod straight up saying that she uses slurs and the lack of response. I’m really not sure that I can continue here knowing this.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/25661/Beep-Boop-Is-A-Slur-Too#1376994">Count me among those who are surprised and disappointed that jessamyn admitted to using slurs while playing Scrabble. There&#39;s really nothing good to come from making such an admission, and once you admit it you have to own it and the serious side-eye it will bring. I&#39;m sure, as Brandon said, that it is pretty common in closed groups, but that doesn&#39;t make saying it out loud any less hurtful.</a></p>

<p>[I cannot fathom using slurs in a Scrabble game, nor the kind of &quot;closed group&quot; that would find use of slurs acceptable. I&#39;m also disappointed, but not surprised, to see that all the talk about making Metafilter more welcoming was just talk, and nothing&#39;s really changing. More people are being driven away, while we defend use of slurs in a game as perfectly fine and acceptable.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t with this crap anymore. I&#39;m gone, too. I already withdrew my financial support. I just can&#39;t spend time in this toxic place anymore.](<a href="https://metatalk.metafilter.com/25661/Beep-Boop-Is-A-Slur-Too#1377030">https://metatalk.metafilter.com/25661/Beep-Boop-Is-A-Slur-Too#1377030</a>)</p>
