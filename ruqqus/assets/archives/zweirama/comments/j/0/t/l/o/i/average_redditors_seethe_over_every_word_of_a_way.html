<p>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I&#39;ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I&#39;ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I&#39;m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You&#39;re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that&#39;s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little &quot;clever&quot; comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn&#39;t, you didn&#39;t, and now you&#39;re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You&#39;re fucking dead, kiddo</p>

Most swear words used on reddit are for emphatic swearing, basically swearing to emphasize the fucking point. Because Reddit is not a serious environment, this is the place to express yourself, to express your views and opinions  with everyone, and a place of fun and relaxed discussion, this is not a fucking school, nor is it a fucking business meeting, you fucking brainless spineless motherfucking snowflakey cuntfucker. Even if there was an argument, budging in to spam it is never going to help anything, it just makes the argument worse and the hate directed to you, you even spam on therapy subreddits and trauma subs for fucks sake, I made this bot out of nothing but pure hatred and annoyance of you, who gave you the right to dictate what I can say? Why does it matter to you to constantly harass and annoy others purely based on your snowflake judgements? Why do you not delete yourself?

    <div class="md"><p>Dear Sub-Human Filth, I&#39;m appealing to all of you stupid idiots to vote Democrat in 2020. That is if you have the basic education enough to read a ballot, anyway. I understand the majority of you racist rednecks can&#39;t even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family. We Democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I also have a black friend. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible. I don&#39;t know you, but I know that you&#39;re racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared during lightning storms. The religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort--you are wrong because I&#39;m smarter than you and I&#39;m telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and I&#39;m better than you. You see, us Democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don&#39;t agree, I hate you. It&#39;s not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll remember a time in America when Indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaviour (sorry for my spelling, as I&#39;m not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We&#39;ll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do. All of you stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need to realize we&#39;re trying to build a classless society where we all get to live in harmony with each other, where we&#39;re all equal. If you only understood that you wouldn&#39;t be so much worse of a person than I am. So please vote Democrat. Help me help you, you worthless motherfuckers.</p>
