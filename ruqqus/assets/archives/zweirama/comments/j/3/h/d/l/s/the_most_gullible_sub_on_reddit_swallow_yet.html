    <div class="md"><p>just look at this top comment lol, what an absolute sperg</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trolls don&#39;t seem to understand that fascists don&#39;t have to be white to be supremacist. Take a look at the &quot;Morenazis&quot; of South America, often featured on <a href="/r/beholdthemasterrace">/r/beholdthemasterrace</a> for their clueless hateful ideology.</p>

<p>Plenty of examples of movements accepting token figures, like Milo Yiannopoulos the gay alt-righter, Blaire White the trans anti-trans activist. &quot;Tiny&quot; Tusitala Toese of Proud Boys isn&#39;t white; he just believes the 14-word party line &quot;We are proud Western chauvinists who refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.&quot; In Obama&#39;s words, they didn&#39;t build that. You can&#39;t claim responsibility for your ancestors&#39; deeds and shirk off any blame for their misdeeds. You can have anti-immigrant, anti-&quot;degeneracy&quot;, anti-feminist movements that are fascistic while allowing members of all races. (Just watch, though, members will still profile the shit out of anyone who doesn&#39;t look like them or act deferent enough)</p>

<p>See Jesse Lee Peterson and Candace Owens, black conservatives -- Peterson says that black people were better off under slavery because at least the families were together back then.</p>

<p>See Kaitlin Bennett and Lori Alexander the Transformed Wife, both of whom argue that women should not be allowed to vote.</p>

<p>We have some political examples of people working against their identity groups, like the Jewish Stephen Miller) and the late Black politician Herman Cain.</p>

<p>And if you go back to the times when fascism first catapulted into the public eye, there&#39;s also the Jewish co-founder of the SS (the Nazi division responsible for implementing the Holocaust) Emil Maurice; he was also Hitler&#39;s personal chauffeur and friend. Hat tip to <a href="/u/nowarclasswar">/u/nowarclasswar</a> for this example.</p>

<p>The Association of German National Jews, a German Jewish organization during the Weimar Republic and the early years of Nazi Germany that eventually came out in support of Adolf Hitler. They supported &quot;total assimilation of Jews into the German Volksgemeinschaft, self-eradication of Jewish identity, and the expulsion from Germany of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.&quot;</p>

<p>Ernst Röhm was the head of the Nazi SA (Sturmabteilung) forces, known for being gay. He was executed during a 1934 purge, largely due to his homosexuality.</p>

<p>It&#39;s common enough for people to join movements that will eventually turn on them. <a href="/r/leopardsatemyface">/r/leopardsatemyface</a> showed us that.</p>

<p>Edited to include Emil Maurice and links about each public figure.</p>

<p>Yeah I&#39;m sure this is what he actually said. Not a wilful attempt to twist the words of a milquetoast conservative into slavery apologism. </p>
