    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion, unless you’re actually putting yourself out there energetically, (performing rituals, working and manipulating energy), it’s very rare that something would just attach itself to you.</p>

<p>When you practice magic, you open yourself up and become a beacon of light, so to speak. Things may become attracted to you because you’re already working with energy/making waves in the astral. </p>

<p>But if you’re not doing any energy workings, not doing any rituals, just reading, I seriously doubt that anything maleficent has attached itself to you. </p>

<p>I suffer from depression and dealt with a 2 year bout of PostPartum Depression and PTSD, so I’m very wary of people blaming their problems on “hocus pocus”.  I’m not saying that it’s impossible for people to encounter entities, even possession can happen, but it’s rare that it would happen to someone who is not actively working with “magic”. </p>

<p>Now, for a solution, by all means, if you want to perform some form of cleansing, or a ritual of separation and protection, hey, if it helps to make you feel better, go ahead. But I think you should look into some mundane solutions for what seem to me to be mundane problems.</p>

<p>Edited to clarify: when I was going through my 2 years of mental hell (PPD &amp; PTSD) I was actively working towards gaining Second Level Initiation with the group I was working with. During that time, I had to pay close attention to what was happening magically versus what was happening with in my own head, Due to my own mental illness. In the headspace that I was in, it would’ve been very easy for me to suddenly think that all of these things in my head were happening because of magical reasons. I kept a journal and shared with my Magus (who had 25+ years of magical training), and I was able to keep the two separate. But it’s easy for me to look back and see how I could have easily blamed my very mundane problems on the astral/magical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People avoid the &quot;how does it work&quot; question because nobody really knows the answer. It&#39;s just like quantum mechanics. Nobody really knows how it works. All we have is models and data (in the case of quantum theory, we also have the math that describes it) (check out Dean Radin for the data on magic). </p>

<p>I can write a bit about my model for the sake of discussion. </p>

<p>Imagine you draw a person with a pencil on the right side of a  piece of paper. When you grab the left side of the same piece of paper and shake it, the person you&#39;ve drawn moves. When you grab person on the right side and shake, the left side of the paper outside of the person moves. The person is not seperate from the paper, but rather enmeshed in it. The lead of the pencil does not serve as a boundary that makes the person truly seperate from the medium on which he is drawn. The lead is just a demarcation. </p>

<p>By analogy, reality is a medium in which we are enmeshed. When we make internal maneuvers, we can see external effects, and conversely external events have an impact on our internal states. Magick is the technology that works with this bi directional interface between inner and outer.</p>

<p>The effect seems to reach backwards in time and be retro causal. One can do magick now and get a resulting effect whose initial material cause predates the magic. Thats a mindfuck.</p>

<p>The effect is activated not through the rational, conversational, discursive thought (which is where I think you might be stuck) , but with a deeper, more &quot;primitive&quot; pre-verbal type of thought. To get a sense of what this means in practice, you might check out some &quot;New Thought&quot; teachers. I&#39;m particularly fond of Neville Goddard (there&#39;s a subreddit). The technique is basically to visualize the end state you wish to achieve, to live in the end. Actually experience the end state of the wish fulfilled. Bonus points for doing it when in a light trance state akin to sleep, and further bonus points for filtering all competing thoughts from your mind during normal day to day activities.</p>

<p>These techniques I think are foundational, and should be explored before adding any extra layers of magical complexity which don&#39;t seem to be strictly necessary. Even the chaos magic as described by Chapman for example is a kind of transference. Instead of working with the desire directly, we work with some kind of ritualized symbol of the desire. This transference may be helpful in some cases, but again, it is a layer of complexity that isn&#39;t strictly necessary, and may confuse the beginning practicioner. </p>

<p>Anyway, one fundamental presupposition about reality that enables and explains magic is that matter arises from conciousness, and not the other way around. Although, even that particular belief isn&#39;t strictly necessary, since there are magicians that subscribe to a psychological model that doesn&#39;t require the primacy of conciousness to be true.</p>

<p>I have rambled a bit, so I&#39;ll stop here. I&#39;m very willing to go deeper with you on any of this if you&#39;d like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two weeks of total abstinence from orgasm, accompanied with daily &quot;edging&quot; (no ejaculation or orgasm is allowed.) During the edging, fantasize about your target. I think you&#39;d be best off edging before bed. Be careful with the edging. If you go to far, you&#39;ll blow the ritual and you need to start over.</p>

<p>Time this so that the ritual climaxes on the night BEFORE the full moon. Two nights before the full moon is also acceptable.</p>

<p>On the final night of the ritual, have an alarm go off once every 30-60 minutes, depending on how long tend to take to fall back to sleep. You need the alarm waking you up constantly throughout the night so that you&#39;ll be able to remember your dreams. Have a tape recorder nearby, and be sure to make of note of ANY dreams that you have. Then go back to sleep until the next alarm sounds.</p>

<p>If you like, you can ornament your ritual with stuff like incense and candles, for effect, which you can utilize during your edging sessions. Perhaps some sort of &quot;virgin silk pajamas&quot; would be appropriate for you to wear on the final night of the ritual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Continuing on my explanation of white people fucking animals:</p>

<p>&quot;White people&quot; here can refer to any Caucasian person or any other person of another ethnicity that behaves in the same colonial mannerisms, this is why we switched to saying colonist or settler because it more accurately describes the type of cross-ethnicity insantiy that is the concept of &quot;white supremacy&quot;. So many indigenous people have been indoctrinated into this system over the last few hundred years that its very difficult to seperate out some people from this (like me)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As-Salaamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu</p>

<p>Today, It’s always right vs left, but Islam is “Wassatiyya”, or “Of the Moderate”/“moderate”, and we both know there is degeneracy and evil on both sides.</p>

<p>On the left you have normalization of Sodomy: all this trans gender whatever it may be, communism, atheism, abortion, women’s promiscuousness disguised as freedom, racism, totalitarianism, prejudice, drug use, pedophilia and other anti-Islamic ideologies.</p>

<p>On the right you have Conservatism: especially fiscally (screw everyone, no charity, only worry about myself), Ultra Nationalism, Right Totalitarianism, fascism, racism, prejudice, etc.</p>

<p>I know I’m not a perfect person, and far from a perfect Muslim. But each and every single day living in the US I see more and more things that sicken me, or make me want to move. And I just think about Islam, and how Islam cures these issues (that are disguised as “Freedoms”), not only on the Governmental/Political level, but also the societal, familial, and personal level. In the heart.</p>

<p>I’ve done a lot of bad things, and haven’t been the best person, but today is Friday, and a new day.</p>

<p>Whenever you see something horrible on the news, remember Islam is spreading like wildfire because it is the ONLY WAY. It is impossible to live any other way and be happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not funny, you&#39;re not clever, and no matter how much or how often you tell yourself otherwise, making other people angry has absolutely no value whatsoever. Even the enjoyment is fleeting; you know that. The rush you get never lasts. You spend your days being shocking for the sake of it, rolling in deeper and more wretched sewage like it&#39;s a race to the bottom of every ladder in the universe, and for what? You&#39;re not special. You&#39;re not in an exclusive club of the clued-in and the free-thinking. You are wearing a thin mask consisting of edgy memes, shock value and faux nihilism that you&#39;ve convinced yourself is good enough to call a personality, that you think will cover up the nothing behind it. You&#39;re wrong.</p>

<p>Step back, reflect, admit your faults and grow up.</p>
