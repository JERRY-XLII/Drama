    <div class="md"><p>Bring it on bitch. Why is hindutva a cancer of society ?</p>

<p>Is israel not a jewish homeland ?</p>

<p>Is china not believes in its indigenous empire of Zhongguo (aka middle kingdom?)</p>

<p>Is USA not a &quot;promised land&quot; , the greatest country on earth ?</p>

<p>Does Russia not follow the concept of Russki Meir ???</p>

<p>Does middle eastern nations not uphold their cultural values ?</p>

<p>Does turkey not consider itself as a once sort of &quot;has been&quot; ottoman empire ??</p>

<p>Does european nations never had their own sovereign kingdoms ???</p>

<p>Or does the japanese follow your songs like ,&quot;a world without borders&quot; ?</p>

<p>Was Tibet not invaded by mao ? Ironically HH DALAI LAMA ALSO SAID THAT EUROPE IS FOR EUROPEANS several times. Much to your dismay btw. &quot;no unpack your going back&quot; that is a tibetan proverb.</p>

<p>Now coming to your topic of NRC, in 1971 when the current BANGLADESH (the then EAST PAKISTAN) was in a state of something called OPERATION SEARCHLIGHT (google it to broaden the horizon of a BROAD LIKE YOU),</p>

<p>Millions of women were RAPED by pakistani army in broad daylight. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_Bangladesh_Liberation_War">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_Bangladesh_Liberation_War</a></p>

<p>Even the U.S. fleet was in the straits of Malacca to nuke INDIA, now USSR was on india&#39;s side.</p>

<p>After the war, due to border destruction by 24 million illegals and coming in more every year and doubling down since the borders are divided by rivers, mountains, other natural habitat.</p>

<p>So more crimes, more rapes, communal riots, terror attacks across india and in north eastern states where they even changed the DEMOGRAPHIC stock of the ab-origin people (like assam) and there were communal riots across india.</p>

<p>When r/islam calls for waging a war against hindus and killing the infidels you pussies would never try to virtue-signal about that. But since you yourself could be a dandy sjw employed by the UMMAH, i think that is where your reasoning goes back to.</p>

<p>If NRC could be atleast commenced to be implemented in Assam, then why not all over india ??</p>

<p>3rd, yes i talked about population control, why ? India already has 1.3 billion people, obviously your friends from UMMAH who always have a wet dream of raping a hindu girl under their doctrine of #LoveJihad and #GhazwaEHind would never contribute to the indian society, only a few like Dr. A.P.J. Kalam ,he us already disbanded amongst the indian muslim community as a BAD MUSLIM.</p>

<p>4th, this NRC (which includes deportation of only ILLEGALS) not LEGALS. I know as a shithead you have a hard time understanding it anyways.</p>

<p>5th- i didn&#39;t call for killing or genociding muslims (its a different matter what they are doing altogether since the islamic invasion of the indian sub-continent 1400 years ago, but anyways its a different story). I merely called for deporting the illegal bangladeshis and rohingyas who leech on the resources of our country and its poorest people.</p>

<p>6th- now lets come for the REAL TALK about the &quot;LEGAL ONES&quot; aka those who did not go to pakistan (both west pakistan and east pakistan). Well, why did they not leave india after 15.08.1947 ??? I mean did they ? Why ? Well all of them from C.P. &amp; Berar state (earlier known as central province ) &amp; other minority muslims voted for MUSLIM LEAGUE and a pork eating , alcoholic , T.B. patient as their so called MUSLIM LEADER. Well on 15.08.1947 40% of world&#39;s hindu population used to live in the then pakistan , what is the percentage of hindu population NOW ?? I mean you could always look at the rising muslim demography in india.</p>

<p>So yes i said all of that and i provided context as well. You could go and fuck yourselves now. For all i care you stupid ass mush.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Rape during the Bangladesh Liberation War</strong></p>

<p>During the 1971 Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women and girls in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. During the war, a fatwa in Pakistan declared that the Bengali freedom fighters were &quot;Hindus&quot; and that their women could be taken as the &quot;booty of war&quot;. Imams and Muslim religious leaders publicly declared that the Bengali women were gonimoter maal (war booty) and thus they openly supported the rape of Bengali women by the Pakistani Army.The activists and leaders of Islamic parties were also involved in the rapes and abduction of women. Scholars have suggested that rape was used to terrorise both the Bengali-speaking Muslim majority and the Hindu minority of Bangladesh.</p>
