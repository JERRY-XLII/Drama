    <div class="md"><p>u/EbenumStudios I do believe it is quite acceptable to use the h*lodomor to criticise the Soviet Union, surely? Western leftists can validly point to it as an issue of why an authoritarian strain of left wing ideology can be problematic. Also there is undeniably -some- oppression, even if limited, of the uyghur people in China, is that not concerning at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First and foremost, <a href="https://msuweb.montclair.edu/%7Efurrg/vv.html">the famine that is called the Holodomor was largely fabricated</a> by a shoddy journalist, Thomas Walker, working for the fascist William Randolph Hearst, as well as the German Ewald Ammende in the 30s. When you examine the primary evidence they provide, Walker&#39;s photographs are from a variety of years, some from the Volga famine in the 20s, some from a famine in Austria-Hungary before the end of the first world war. Ammende himself sites Walker&#39;s work in his own book, in which he also sites Nazi documents. Since then, the myth was hyped up by Ukranian nationalists and Nazi collaborators until it was picked up by the US post-war.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Holodomor_World_recognition.png/1280px-Holodomor_World_recognition.png">If you look at a map of countries that recognize this supposed genocide as such,</a> there are only former communist states, who have a vested interest in demonizing their former &quot;oppressor&quot; so their country has a foundation to stand on, and a mixed bag of anticommunist nations.</p>

<p>Does this mean there was no famine? Not per se, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;url=http://www.ier.hit-u.ac.jp/rrc/Japanese/pdf/RRC_WP_No67.pdf&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwi0gKTlt7zjAhXEVc0KHdDRC40QFjAKegQIBhAB&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw361TIIfW6trJ8Cl4vy9p4s">crop yields and the number of farm animals were down in the early thirties</a>. Why was this, however? Because of a vast Stalinist plot to murder Ukranians? Or because of the class war that was raging among the peasantry at the time, where the kulaks stubbornly destroyed their equipment and purposefully ruined their crop and killed their animals so they wouldn&#39;t be collectivized? The latter is the only one backed up by evidence.</p>

<p>Moving on to China, are there camps there? Yes, reeducation camps. Are there millions of Uyghur there? <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-18/china-says-13-000-xinjiang-terrorists-arrested-since-2014">No, only a few tens of thousands who have had Islamist sympathies.</a> Going into more detail is difficult, considering the deluge of propaganda in the Western media. However, the UN sent a delegation to Xinjiang <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un/china-says-reached-broad-consensus-with-un-after-xinjiang-visit-idUSKCN1TH00T">and they did not comdemn the camps.</a> When looking at a map of who supports China&#39;s policy, <a href="https://supchina.com/2019/07/16/a-letter-praising-counter-terrorism-program-in-xinjiang-from-37-countries/">numerous countrues, including several Muslim ones, back China except for the West.</a> Isn&#39;t it strange how that image almost matches perfectly the countries who backed Maduro earlier this year? I will admit that perhaps things are worse than I say they are, I am not there to see what goes on and my access to unbiased sources is limited. But should I trust the NYT when they say <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/world/asia/china-xinjiang-rights.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FUighurs%20(Chinese%20Ethnic%20Group">a million or more have been detained?</a>&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection) The same NYT that <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2019/06/24/new-york-times-media-us-government-approval/">sends its stories to the US government for approval, to make sure security advisors don&#39;t have any complaints?</a> We have seen time and time again that anything that threatens American hegemony is a national security threat, and China is the greatest security threat of them all. If the media weren&#39;t talking about the &quot;Uyghur Concentration Camps,&quot; America would look worse on the international stage because of our own barbaric camps. But with this handy narrative being propagated by the press, America doesn&#39;t look as bad by comparison.</p>

<p>No, I do not believe that either can justify attacks on &quot;authoritarian&quot; communism. The alleged genocide is the product of fascist propaganda, while the Chinese case has been exaggerated beyond belief by liberal propaganda. Besides, are we supposed to believe that re-education camps for religious fanatics are worse than what America would do to them, either bomb them or torture them in a CIA black site? Without such re-education programs, how are you to humanely stamp out such a threat?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow, those are actually some very interesting sources, especially about the UN delegation. however, on closer inspection of that article, it actually notes that &quot;U.N. experts say some one million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are held in detention centers &quot; and that the UN isn&#39;t exactly known for criticising countries on the security council.</p>

<p>I would just add that i don&#39;t think anybody who opposes what they perceive to be chinese concentration camps think that they are any worse than what america does to religious fanatic threats. </p>

<p>otherwise, quite an interesting view of the soviet union and china.</p>
