<p>I noticed you dropped 31 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just fucking shit and cum. </p>

<p><strong>FUCKING FAQ</strong> </p>

<p><strong>What the fuck does this mean?</strong> </p>

<p>The amount of fucking shit (and cum) on my fucking computer and floor has fucking increased by one. </p>

<p><strong>Why the fuck did you fucking do this?</strong> </p>

<p>There are several fucking reasons I may deem a fucking comment to be fucking worthy of fucking feces or ejaculation. These include, but are not fucking limited to: </p>

<p>*Being fucking gay </p>

<p>*Dank fucking copypasta bro, where&#39;d you fucking find it </p>

<p>*fucking walter </p>

<p><strong>Am I going to fucking shit and cum too?</strong> </p>

<p>No - not yet. But you should fucking refrain from fucking shitposting and cumposting like this in the fucking future. Otherwise I will be forced to fucking shit and cum again, which may fucking put your fucking shitting and cumming privileges in fucking jeopardy. </p>

<p><strong>I don&#39;t fucking believe my fucking comment deserved being fucking shit and cum at. Can you fucking un-cum it?</strong> </p>

<p>Sure, mistakes fucking happen. But only in fucking exceedingly rare fucking circumstances will I put fucking shit back into my fucking butt. If you would fucking like to issue an fucking appeal, fucking shoot me a hot fucking load explaining what the fuck I fucking got wrong. I tend to fucking respond to retaliatory ejaculation within several fucking minutes. Do fucking note, however, that over 99.9% of semen fucking dies before it can fucking fertilize the fucking egg, and yours is likely no fucking exception. </p>

<p><strong>How the fuck can I fucking prevent this from fucking happening in the fucking future?</strong> </p>

<p>Accept the fucking goopy brown and white substance and move on. But learn from this fucking mistake: your fucking behavior will not be fucking tolerated in my mom&#39;s fucking basement. I will continue to fucking shit and cum until you fucking improve your fucking conduct. Remember: ejaculation is a fucking privilege, not a fucking right.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 31 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>
