        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So my brother-in-law lives with us because he is a loser and an r-slur. He&#39;s 23 and still depends on my wife and me to parent him. All he does is play video games and goes to parties on the weekend.</p>

<p>So within 2 years, he has had 3 girlfriends... maybe more, I think I forgot a hoe. I know that any girl he brings over is trash because they are willing to go inside his room. His room looks like the average neckbeard&#39;s room and smells like a homeless man. </p>

<p>So the first hoe is the ex-girlfriend of his best friend. Even though they broke up, they are still friends (the r-slur didn&#39;t see that red flag lol).</p>

<p>So they would all hang out together. He would invite his best friend and his girlfriend and they would hang out in his room and sleepover (3some?). Anyway, one day she said she didn&#39;t want to hang out with him and that she wanted to hang out with her ex-boyfriend and sleepover at his place because they are still friends 😂😂😂</p>

<p>My BiL said no but she did it anyway, he came home crying when he found out and slammed his door like a teenage girl on her period. His best friend said they didn&#39;t have sex and he believed him 🤣🤣</p>

<p>But he broke up with the hoe, after that she slept with all of his other friends but still believes his best friend didn&#39;t sleep with her.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>A month later he is dating a nurse that looks like a middle-aged meth addict. I asked if she was and it turns out she is just ugly. He broke up with her because he talked to her about &quot;his depression&quot; and she laughed at him and said depression is a joke 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>A month later I see small-sized shoes outside of the apartment. I&#39;m like &quot;WTF? Is there a child here?&quot;</p>

<p>Turns out he is dating a 16-year-old. In the morning she comes out of his room and walks by me as I am making breakfast and says hello. I&#39;m like &quot;Where is your daddy?&quot; cause I know no father would allow his kid to sleep in a grown man&#39;s place.</p>

<p>Bitch tells me she&#39;s an orphan 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣</p>

<p>She ended up breaking with him because he texted her too much and it annoyed her so she dumped his clingy ass 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂</p>
