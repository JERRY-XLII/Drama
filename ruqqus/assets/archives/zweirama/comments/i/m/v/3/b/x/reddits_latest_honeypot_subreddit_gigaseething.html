<p>oh and btw there will always be censorship, its inevitable, power brings corruption and with such dysfunctional ideologies we have today, its going to be like that, communism is bad but capitalism is too, bc we have people working their asses of to be a doctor or a emgineer to make money and live a comfortable life, and have it destroyed by a retard who wants war, and ruins the economy in few seconds, who didnt even deserve it he just seemed to be born in a family that tends to be political and he just took the will, made as much money and ran away in to swizarland. Aka every slavic politician.</p>

<p>powerful reddit moment</p>

<p>edit: this intense gamer seethe over t-slurs in their video games reminds me of when jagex held that in-game Gay Pride Week event in oldschool runescape, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vzWFsaj.png">that shit was nuclear</a></p>

<p>Every year i hear gamers bitching about women in video games, but these are the same games that continue topping the charts, so that clearly means these g*mers arent capable of following through with their simple plan of not buying the fucking game</p>

<p>Battlefield 1 and Five, TLOU2 for example were significantly less successful than their predecessors. Woke products are only successful in their niche, or when they hoodwink unexpecting normies, and in doing so, permanently devaluing the brand.</p>

<p>Dude gamers lmao</p>

<p>Boycotts don&#39;t work because the gamers screeching about t-slurs or feminism or literal white genocide in their vidya are a tiny minority. AAA games sell in millions, average person buying them could not care less about any of this, they most likely don&#39;t even know about it. They literally just wanna play videogames after school/work, not discuss them at large on gay ass internet forums.</p>

<p>The retard below me saying BF sold less is completely missing the fact BF V came out in the height of popularity of Battle Royale games... without a Battle Royale mode. Ofc it sold like shit. BF 1 had a slow multiplayer and people kept playing BF3/BF4 instead.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II#Sales">TLOU2 still sold amazingly well</a>, again literally nobody but some tards in small online bubbles care about any of the shit gaymers criticized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still don&#39;t get why they screech so much about it. Shit like &quot;yeah Soldier 76 was a bussylover&quot; affects nothing yet g*mers still cry oppression about it. Imagine having a consumer hobby and being mad about it not being perfectly tailored to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gonna serious post real quick. Watch out on that sub if you dont like gore. Idk if the vid of the guy blowing his head off with a 12 gauge is still up, but someone made a very gory post of a dude blowing his head off with a 12 gauge and no warning of what it was in the title. Kinda fucked me up for a few hours. </p>

<p>Tldr watch out for gore in that sub.. The degens there wont warn you if theres gore in a post</p>
