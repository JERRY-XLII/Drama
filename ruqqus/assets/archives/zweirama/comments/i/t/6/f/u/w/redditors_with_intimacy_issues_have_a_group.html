    <div class="md"><p>Some choice quotes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is also why forcing your kids to go to church and take communion is also wrong. Seriously, making kids kneel down and eat and drink stuff they don’t want to? Gross.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Children need to understand that it&#39;s okay to say no to adults touching them, even if it&#39;s just a hug from grandma. Otherwise they don&#39;t always know it&#39;s okay to say no to other touching. Bodily autonomy and consent are really important for kids to learn. The whole point of this is to protect them from predators.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes. Tickle trauma is a very real thing. When I was really young, a friend’s dad used to tickle me into a state of breathless panic and tears. Now, I often react to some slight physical touch like I would if it were a hot knife. It’s a real problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>This was basically my upbringing, I&#39;m 28 now and still haven&#39;t gone on a date because I can&#39;t stand the idea of physical contact. Fortunately, my parents have given up on grand children, but they brought this on themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Agreed. When I was younger my grandpa asked me for a kiss and I said no and everyone was saying things like “come on don’t you love your grandpa?? Come onnnn” and my mom pulled her camera out and took a picture of my grandpa forcing me in for a kiss. Love that man, but holy fuck I never realized how weird that shit was</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Based Latinchad dropping wisdom on mayos</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man this is a fucking dumb opinion. Totally American or European perspective. In Latin America if you don&#39;t greet your elder family members, you get told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dumbass shut in redditors adapted the consent dialogue about dating and extrapolated that to literally every single interaction possible. &quot;Grandma hugging/kissing me without my explicit consent? Well you&#39;ve scarred me for life. No, it can&#39;t possibly be the fact that my reactions are abnormal and are an indicator of larger issues regarding intimacy and socialization. It&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault for not adapting to my unreasonable needs.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get the joy of old ladies forcing kids to kiss them, though. Obviously this is not rape. I still don&#39;t get it. Just because it is not rape does not mean it is reasonable. A 70yo adult should be able to handle that a kid does not want to kiss them. I mean, the obvious solution to this whole (non-)issue is to simply not kiss little Bobby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What &quot;deeper issues&quot;? If the kid has deeper issues with contact, then don&#39;t force contact on him lmfao</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, people always talk about how evil statutory pedo is because it &quot;causes intimacy issues&quot; or something (even with that weird Netflix kino lol), but then when people report unpleasant feelings from actual unwanted contact from family members they get mocked for their &quot;intimacy issues&quot; - just complete npcs lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The deeper issues are in reference to the spergs saying they were traumatized as a result of grammy giving them a hug when they didn&#39;t want it. There are people in that thread blaming family members giving them friendly hugs as reason they haven&#39;t had sex despite being in their late 20s.</p>

<p>Those &quot;people&quot; you&#39;re talking about get mocked because they try to conflate the trauma from experiencing sexual molestation with their grandparents giving them a hug when they want to play legos instead. It&#39;s deserved, and they&#39;re not actually woke about intimacy issues and are just mentally ill people confirming each other&#39;s delusions.</p>

<p>Unrelated to the actual topic:</p>

<p>I used to think this, too. But the older I got, the more I realized the crazy old people were actually pretty crazy when they were young, too.</p>

<p>One harmless example is the use of computers. Being a 60yo is not an excuse why you can&#39;t write a simple letter with a PC. They were younger than 40 when PCs were the standard way to write one. And besides this, 60 is actually not too old to still learn simple stuff. They are just retarded. I mean, others are 80 and can use PCs.</p>
