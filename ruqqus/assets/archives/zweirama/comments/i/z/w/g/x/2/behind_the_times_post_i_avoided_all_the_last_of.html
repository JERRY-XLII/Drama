    <div class="md"><p>i also finished the game yesterday actually, after reading the leaks, watching some leaked cutscenes, and then watching streamers play it.</p>

<p>I decided after the leaks I wasn&#39;t gonna buy it. I decided after watching the ending that I didn&#39;t like the story and would probably never play it.</p>

<p>But, I have this one friend who always buys physical copies of big releases, even though he&#39;s kind of a NEET and still has a giant backlog of stuff he needs to compulsively platinum or 100% before he gets to this new shit, unless it&#39;s like, a new Pokemon (ugh) or Zelda or some shit. </p>

<p>He insisted I borrow his copy, and I kept it for two months before finally playing it.</p>

<p>So, straight up, if you like 3rd person stealth action shooty games, like I do, the gameplay mostly slaps, and some encounters are intense as fuck. I had a lot of fun. </p>

<p>The tech and graphics are also seriously impressive. It is kinda messed up to think about how much work went into animating so many gruesome deaths, though.</p>

<p>Now, when it comes to experiencing the story firsthand: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Joel dying is expected, but it happening so early is done for arguably cheap shock value. Plus the deceptive marketing makes it understandable why people got pissed, they literally faked a trailer where he is alive and helps you and then it ends up being Jesse who does so in the game</p></li>
<li><p>the constant flashbacks do paint a bigger picture but they get irritating, and I found myself wondering if the game would work chronologically. Or rather, wishing they made it work chronologically, with Joel dying as an act 2 ending or so.</p></li>
<li><p>because of the structure you miss out on important context of stuff that happened before the game, until literally the end of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s clear what they were trying to do with Abby and eventually Lev, trying to make a mirror of the first game, but The Last of Us relied and thrived so strongly on the specific Ellie and Joel dynamic that by taking that duo away from us, people were obviously gonna be resistant to whatever replaced it</p></li>
<li><p>That said, after fucking up Abby&#39;s life so hard, it&#39;s pretty easy to empathize with her, even to the point where she&#39;s about to kill a pregnant Dina (knowing that Ellie just killed her pregnant friend, and her lover). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, but here is the big issue why in the end, the story falls flat:</p>

<p>Ellie&#39;s stupid flip flopping about where she&#39;s going to kill Abby in the last part of the game, and then ultimately sparing her, is completely cheapened by the fact that Ellie undoubtedly ruined HUNDREDS of other lives in a similar way to how she did Abby&#39;s by killing all those people to get to her.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog goes out of their way to make these people seem real by giving them names and having their buddies freak out and cry for them when you fuck them up (side note: in santa barbara i&#39;m pretty sure i killed 3 different guys named Matteo in 3 different encounters), but Ellie (or Abby with scars or even wolves) never seems to give a fuck.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know why exactly Ellie spared her... guilt for killing all her friends, not wanting to be as extreme as Joel, maybe just realizing it wouldn&#39;t actually make her feel better? But if she clued in 5 minutes earlier she&#39;d still have her fingers. If she never left, she&#39;d still have a family.</p>

<p>sigh</p>

<p>tl;dr </p>

<p>fuck you for making me type this but i might post it to the tlou2 sub at some point.</p>

<p>game is a 7/10, fun, but pretentious and kinda dumb</p>

<p>i unironically wish i was a seraphite (their war with WLF was interesting too, I thought)</p>

<p>edit: what in the bot hell did this post unleash?!?</p>

<p>I actually loved how intense the violence is, and how fucked up a lot of the deaths are. I appreciate the work involved, not implying you disagree or agree. Like I totally thought I died before Joel saved ellie from that bloater</p>

<p>I dont watch trailers until after I finish anything, and only things I really like, so that wasn&#39;t a factor for me</p>

<p>If I have time to play videogames, I have time to drink, so I was at least kinda drunk most of the time I was playing and had  a hard time with the chronological shit late in the game, so I don&#39;t really know if I can comment on that</p>

<p>Fuck those people, I like tragedy in my media</p>

<p>What I got out of it was that she continued her revenge shit because she thought it would help her with her PTSD or whatever but ultimately realized it wouldn&#39;t so there wasn&#39;t a point</p>

<p>Dude there are so are many enemies named chris, zach and skyler, they definitely recycled some voice acting. Still a dope feature tho</p>

<p>Revenge doesn&#39;t really help you feel better and two headed viper whatever  is like the main aesop of the game</p>

Even if there was an argument, budging in to spam it is never going to help anything, it just makes the argument worse and the hate directed to you, you even spam on therapy subreddits and trauma subs for fucks sake, I made this bot out of nothing but pure hatred and annoyance of you, who gave you the right to dictate what I can say? Why does it matter to you to constantly harass and annoy others purely based on your snowflake judgements? Why do you not delete yourself?
