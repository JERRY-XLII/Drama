<h1>Imagine a society that subjects people to  conditions that make them terribly unhappy then gives them the drugs to  take away their unhappiness. Science fiction It is already happening to  some extent in our own society. Instead of removing the conditions that  make people depressed modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In  effect antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual&#39;s  internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social  conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable</h1>

    <div class="md"><p>However one must also consider what Ted writes in his 2017 version of technological slavery: &quot;The political left is technological society&#39;s first line of defense against revolution.&quot; What &quot;she&quot; proposes may initially seem like a revolt against the system, but in truth it is a furthering of the current system. Or rather what she wants is to take the system in the same direction but to a greater magnitude. Us ted-pilled citizens must never let our movement become political as it will inevitably distract for the industrial technological.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cock and ball torture (CBT), penis torture or dick torture is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks. Ball-busting Edit Ball busting demonstraton in public at Folsom Street Fair, USA</p>

<p>&quot;Ball-busting&quot; is a form of CBT in which a man has his testicles kicked, kneed, punched or squeezed. In addition to its occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (ÁéâËπ¥„Çä) (lit. ball-kicking) is a separate genre in Japan. Like many of the other activities in this article, it carries significant health risks, including the possibility of permanent damage to the testicles through testicular trauma. Ball stretcher Edit A single metal ball stretcher and cock ring, which forces erection.</p>

<p>A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is used to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. This can be particularly enjoyable for the wearer as it can make an orgasm more intense, as testicles are prevented from moving up. Intended to make one&#39;s testicles permanently hang much lower than before (if used regularly for extended periods of time), this sex toy can be potentially harmful to the male genitals as the circulation of blood can be easily cut off if over-tightened.</p>

<p>While leather stretchers are most common, other models consist of an assortment of steel rings that fastens with screws, causing additional but only mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer&#39;s testicles. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches.[2] A more dangerous type of ball stretcher can be home-made simply by wrapping rope or string around one&#39;s scrotum until it is eventually stretched to the desired length. Ball crusher Edit</p>

<p>A ball crusher is a device made from either metal or often clear acrylic that squeezes the testicles slowly by turning a nut or screw. How tight it is clamped depends on the pain tolerance of the person it is used on. A ball crusher is often combined with bondage, either with a partner or by oneself. Parachute Edit</p>

<p>A parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. It is conical in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached.</p>

<p>Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, and a squeezing effect on the testicles. Moderate weights of 3‚Äì5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage, though occasionally much heavier weights are used. Smaller weights can be used when the male wearing it is free to move; the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.[citation needed] Humbler Edit Man with humbler</p>

<p>A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene.</p>

<p>The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the centre of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs folded forward, as any attempt to straighten the legs even slightly pulls hard on the scrotum, causing considerable discomfort. Testicle cuffs Edit</p>

<p>A testicle cuff is a ring-shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it. A common type has two connected cuffs, one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis. They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia. A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum; without the key it cannot be removed.</p>

<p>Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being &quot;owned&quot;, while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of &quot;owning&quot; their partners. Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner, who may be either male or female. There is a level of humiliation involved, by which they find sexual arousal. The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner.[citation needed]</p>

<p>However, these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs. More conventionally, the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation, which has a number of benefits:</p>

<p>Making the penis appear longer. Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone, exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view. Improving sexual arousal. While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being &quot;owned&quot;, the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one&#39;s legs and pointing the toes. Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis, a condition which can be very uncomfortable, especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse. Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the &quot;point of no return&quot;. It is much harder to reach an orgasm.</p>

<p>Cock harness Edit</p>

<p>A cock harness is a penile sex toy designed to be worn around the penis and scrotum. Its function is similar to that of a cock ring. These devices are often associated with BDSM activities. The Gates of Hell is a male chastity device made up of multiple cock rings that can be used for CBT.[3] Kali&#39;s Teeth is a metal bracelet with interior spikes that closes around the penis and can be used for preventing or punishing erections.[4] Safety Edit Learn more This section needs attention from an expert in Health. The specific problem is: concerns medical topics, but lacks appropriate citations.</p>

<p>Loss of blood flow is one of the biggest risks in cock and ball torture (CBT), which can be seen with loss of color and edemas.[5] Bondage in which the testicles are tied to something else is especially dangerous, increasing the risk of the testicles getting damaged through excessive tension or pulling.</p>

<p>The most serious injuries are testicular rupture, testicular torsion and testicular avulsion, which are medical emergencies that require urgent medical attention.[6]</p>

<p>Urethral fingering is an example of CBT which needs special precautions, such as not having a sharp nail on the inserted finger</p>

<p>A woman holding a bound man&#39;s penis applies electricity to his testicles at Folsom Street Fair. It is important that such erotic electrostimulation is done within limits.</p>

<p>A gagged man&#39;s penis and scrotum are pulled using a rope at Folsom Street Fair. It is especially important to have a signal as a safeword during such activities</p>
