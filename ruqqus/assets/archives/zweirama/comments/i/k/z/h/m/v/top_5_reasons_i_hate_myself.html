    <div class="md"><p>Windmill Agogo in Pattaya is by far the best gogo in Thailand, not the cutest girls, but it is all hands on, raunchy action. You can eat women out on the stage from your barstool, the women eat each other out on the stage, theres a jacuzzi in the corner where girls sud themselves with bubbles and you can suds them too. If you buy a girl a ladydrink they&#39;ll sit down with you in those exact school girl outfits with no panties on underneath and you can finger them and cop feels while sipping your drink. Some guys have even copped blowjobs from them in the corner.<br/>
Ah fuck, I miss Thailand so much. Fuck this fake virus and fuck Prayut Chan-o-ch**k.<br/>
I&#39;ve been there probably 10 times.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 31 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 31 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 31 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 14 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>
