<blockquote>
<p>Dear Trump Supporter,</p>

<p>We&#39;re around 2 months away from the upcoming election, and I had some thoughts that might accurately characterize your mental state--I have no expectation that you&#39;ll take them seriously. I have every expectation that the protective self you inhabit so readily, that I will describe in the following words, will dismiss them outright.</p>

<p>I understand that you feel like nobody values you--that the America you once experienced or perceived has left you behind. You ask others, how could I possess privilege for my skin color when all that surrounds me is the desolate remnants of a small town raped of its vitality?</p>

<p>That desolation has created the protective self--the persona with which you have made discrediting, dismissing, and &quot;owning&quot; the &quot;libs&quot; a part-time career--an obsession.</p>

<p>There is nothing for you in the validation of the red hat that you so cherish, nor in its perceived power to enrage fellow citizens who disagree with you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re probably in a job that pays well below what you wish you had. Some of your family, perhaps, even your own children will no longer speak to you. You probably hate feeling like you have as many valid complaints as the nebulous &quot;BLM&quot; movement you abhor, and yet have been validated for none of them. You hate that. You hate anyone who might represent that.</p>

<p>But HE validated you. HE shouted to the world that it isn&#39;t YOUR fault. It isn&#39;t your fault your job laid you off. It isn&#39;t your fault you don&#39;t have the truck you want. It isn&#39;t your fault you don&#39;t get any recognition for your hard work. It isn&#39;t your fault that your children are alienated by you. It isn&#39;t your fault that all these NEW people who live in America hate you. He took you in. He made you feel worthy. He gave you a red hat to signify the &quot;winning&quot; strategy that provides you with protection against this harsh world--symbolism of the soft pillow of security the 2nd amendment provides to you, symbolism of the superiority of being a proud, hardworking American. You are a winner when you wear this hat--and you hate people who think the opposite.</p>

<p>Because of this protective self, you feel validated. &quot;Finally, someone who gets me!&quot; This is a lie. Your protective self is desperately clinging to a dream of an America where it&#39;s okay to be white. It&#39;s okay to like &quot;your people&quot; more than others. It&#39;s okay to be weirded out by men who kiss eachother in public. It&#39;s okay to be a man or woman whose dreams went down the shitter decades ago--he can make all that come back to your reverent hands.</p>

<p>Again, HE took you in. HE made you feel worthy. But there&#39;s a part of this process that your true self is blinded to--you are viewed by everyone who has taken the medicine of rationality and science as a buffoon. The reality of global perspectives views you as an antique--the rusted machinery of a bygone era.</p>

<p>You long for the day when the voices that tear you down will be silenced--when HE will march you onto the stage in front of your peers, pull your adult diaper up the fetid adipose tissue of your atrophied ass-crack, and identify you as a patriot--a person of worth!</p>

<p>The mind of your protective self, even at this moment, rejects this reality as &quot;bullshit from a dumb liberal cuck&quot; because owning that you are, by every metric and standard of our society, a LOSER, would be too crushing a blow to accept--but should you accept this reality, it COULD get better.</p>

<p>You COULD be included in the creation of a splendid new world. You COULD be a part of the society that eliminates cancer, feeds everyone, gives you a well-paying job and terraforms the stars in our own image. You COULD avoid being left behind--I promise you that HE will provide absolutely no salvation for you. You COULD change your lot in life.</p>

<p>But that proposition would require that you lay down your protective self. It would require that you no longer view yourself as a loser, and are willing to put in the work to better yourself WITH us. You COULD dispense with the red cap.</p>

<p>But that proposition is in direct contradiction with where you currently reside:</p>

<p>In a mediocre life filled with ambitions unrealized, nightmares fulfilled, dignity stripped, and aberrations of the mind fed by a cerebral virus that clings to your consciousness and tells you that you are special and will require ZERO effort to improve because you are already PERFECT.</p>

<p>You know that this protective self is a lie. You know that you have work to do. You know that HE and HIS world are a fantasy--a convenient dream. When you have the courage to navigate the worst truths of your psyche--you HATE him... and you HATE yourself even more for believing it.</p>

<p>You KNOW that in the deepest recesses of your mind, the truth lingers, poking and perforating the borders of your perfect dreamland and your unacknowledged brilliance--but there is an &quot;antidote&quot; to this nuisance. Your hand reaches for the remote... HE is but a click away and all that truth can be asphyxiated by HIS perfect little hands.</p>

<p>The sun sets, and drool pools around the collar of your beer-stained shirt, and the superhero within you decays further.</p>

<p>Click. Type. Giggle. Click. Comment. Pause. Sip. Click. Comment. Click. Click.</p>

<p>Happy Dreaming,</p>

<p>Big_Time_Watts</p>

It&#39;s not just Harry Potter, it&#39;s also Marvel, Star Wars, Doctor Who, Pokemon, My Little Pony, and the like, and you would notice that these are very entry-level geek media.
