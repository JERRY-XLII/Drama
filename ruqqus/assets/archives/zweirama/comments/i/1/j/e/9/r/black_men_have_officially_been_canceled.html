<p>I don&#39;t have to choose my race over my sex in political matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well idk the racists don&#39;t demonize black foids anywhere as much as you - whether in terms of being aggressive (though tbf lol) or for doing interracial.</p>

<p>Also black wpmen can&#39;t do feminism or what? How is that an either or?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I read African American History textbooks, I will learn mainly about black men.
When I learn about the Civil Rights Movement &amp; the Black Power Movements, most of the leaders that I will learn about will be black men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Civil Rights Movements was all black men, Black power was aaaall black men lolol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can rely on the fact that in the near 100-year history of national civil rights organizations such as the NAACP and the Urban League, virtually all of the executive directors have been male.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cause blk gussy just can&#39;t get anything done</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will be taken more seriously as a political leader than black women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And hated more too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the substantial role that black women played in the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power Movement, currently there is no black female that is considered a &quot;race leader&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&#39;t Rosa Palms quite up there?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can live my life without ever having read black feminist authors, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that&#39;s certainly enviable LMFAO, fair where&#39;s fair!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or knowing about black women&#39;s history, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So can black women lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or black women&#39;s issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Not knowing about women&#39;s issues&quot; is a weird &quot;privilege&quot; to have - more like not <em>having</em> women&#39;s issues eh? But then that&#39;s tautological and the premise of the whole listicle anyway, so ?</p>

<p>Poor phrasing lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the ability to define black women&#39;s beauty by European standards in terms of skin tone, hair, and body size. In comparison, black women rarely define me by European standards of beauty in terms of skin tone, hair, or body size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whaaaaat, what does that even mean?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not have to worry about the daily hassles of having my hair conforming to any standard image of beauty the way black women do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Curly nigger hair is less popular for the men as well though - nothing like the Lando look lol</p>

<p>So this is femcels being blind towards the way &quot;beauty&quot; and hair charm can be a curse as well as an advantage once again, typical.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not have to worry about the daily hassles of being terrorized by the fear of gaining weight. In fact, in many instances bigger is better for my sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lmfao fatties coping</p>

<p>Hey Queen Latifah seems to be doing alright.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My looks will not be the central standard by which my worth is valued by members of the opposite sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again blessing and curse, feminists just don&#39;t understand anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sex &amp; Sexuality</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s hot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can purchase pornography that typically shows men defile women by the common practice of the &quot;money shot.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Women can also purchase it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can believe that causing pain during sex is connected with a woman&#39;s pleasure without ever asking her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Until he&#39;s rebuked, sure I guess.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the privilege of not wanting to be a virgin, but preferring that my wife or significant other be a virgin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The privilege of having preferences, yeah awesome - why can&#39;t black people just phrase their talking points properly? I think it must be due to them not having gone through an ice age that selected for higher genetic intelligence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to sex if I say &quot;No&quot;, chances are that it will not be mistaken for ‚ÄúYes&quot;.</p>

<p>If I am raped, no one will assume that &quot;I should have known better&quot; or suggest that my being raped had something to do with how I was dressed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol if a man is raped esp. by a woman no one&#39;s gonna give a single fuck anyway. However he&#39;s less likely to be hurt by it unless he&#39;s a fag, so all in all this point is correct, sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can use sexist language like bonin‚Äô, laying the pipe, hittin-it, and banging that convey images of sexual acts based on dominance and performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah so?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can live in a world where polygamy is still an option for men in the United States as well as around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Women are only &quot;more judged&quot; for that among rightoids.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In general, I prefer being involved with younger women socially and sexually</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In general, the more sexual partners that I have the more stature I receive among my peers.</p>

<p>I have easy access to pornography that involves virtually any category of sex where men degrade women, often young women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So do women - why literally repeat this non-point lol?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the privilege of being a part of a sex where &quot;purity balls&quot; apply to girls but not to boys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is this awkward phrasing again?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I consume pornography, I can gain pleasure from images and sounds of men causing women pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah so can women, Christ how many times more??</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Popular Culture</p>

<p>I come from a tradition of humor that is based largely on insulting and disrespecting women; especially mothers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What, your mama jokes? Seriously?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the privilege of not having black women, dress up and play funny characters- often overweight- that are supposed to look like me for the entire nation to laugh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Black fatties coping again lmfao</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I go to the movies, I know that most of the leads in black films are men. I also know that all of the action heroes in black film are men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s cause action is a man&#39;s area - don&#39;t think that disparity applies across genres though; certainly not for mayos;</p>

<p>which is good, cause I find gussy hot and it&#39;d be unfortunate and gay for me if most leads were mails.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can easily imagine that most of the artists in Hip Hop are members of my sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine? What, why &quot;imagine&quot;? Is the writer high or what lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can easily imagine that most of the women that appear in Hip Hop videos are there solely to please men
Most of lyrics I listen to in hip-hop perpetuate the ideas of males dominating women, sexually and socially.
I have the privilege of consuming and popularizing the word pimp, which is based on the exploitation of women with virtually no opposition from other men.
I can hear and use language bitches and hoes that demean women, with virtually no opposition from men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stop listening to hiphop lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can wear a shirt that others and I commonly refer to as a &quot;wife beater&quot; and never have the language challenged.
Many of my favorite movies include images of strength that do not include members of the opposite sex and often are based on violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cause the opposite sex isn&#39;t strong rofl</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of my favorite genres of films, such as martial arts, are based on violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More nebulous phrasing and &quot;preferences are privilege&quot; bullshite - martial arts having to do with violence is privilege lolol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the privilege of popularizing or consuming the idea of a thug, which is based on the violence and victimization of others with virtually no opposition from other men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh? Thugs do get opposed by other thugs - oh and they&#39;re not very pooular among klansmen either lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Attitudes/Ideology</p>

<p>I have the privilege to define black women as having &quot;an attitude&quot; without referencing the range of attitudes that black women have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LMFAO allright black moids have fun reading through the rest of the 100 pages lol</p>
