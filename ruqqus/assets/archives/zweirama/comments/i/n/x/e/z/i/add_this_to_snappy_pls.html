<blockquote>
<p>You act like nothing important is at stake. Trump is trying to install a fascist dictatorship. And people wonder why the left is fed up with the right. Maybe it&#39;s because they try everything in their power to make the world worse. And everyone voting for them is responsible for it. People are angry and if you don&#39;t get why it&#39;s because you aren&#39;t affected. The left tried to play nice where did it lead to? The right never did and now they dehumanize us at every opportunity it&#39;s us or them and THEY are responsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly dislike orange daddy, but I&#39;m not convinced that he&#39;s anymore racist than any other New York Boomer is. That is, he probably has some internal biases or whatever but he&#39;s not going to start burning crosses or taking midnight rides. If anything, I kind of get the sense that he doesn&#39;t really give a shit about race (which is at least equally bad in the eyes of a lot of people). He&#39;s obviously xenophobic and jingoistic, but the dude dislikes yuros at least as much as Mexicans and Chinamen, and possibly more. Nonetheless, the Tr*mp bad 😠 smoothbrains are conditioned to knee-jerk assume it&#39;s a race issue, which ironically undermines a lot of criticism against his often poor policy positions because it comes from people who are either unwilling or unable to argue issues on their facts.</p>

<p>I just downvoted your comment.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>What does this mean?</h2>

<p>The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.</p>

<h2>Why did you do this?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rudeness towards other Redditors,</li>
<li>Spreading incorrect information,</li>
<li>Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a <code>/s</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Am I banned from the Reddit?</h2>

<p>No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.</p>

<h2>I don&#39;t believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?</h2>

<p>Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</p>

<h2>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</h2>

<p>Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h1>What does this mean?</h1>

<p>The amount of shid (and cum) on my computer and floor has increased by one.</p>

<h1>Why did you do this?</h1>

<p>There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be worthy of feces or ejaculation. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being gay</li>
<li>Dank copypasta bro, where&#39;d you find it</li>
<li>walter</li>
</ul>

<h1>Am I going to shid and cum too?</h1>

<p>No  - not yet. But you should refrain from shitposting and cumposting like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to shid and cum again, which may put your shidding and cumming privileges in jeopardy.</p>

<h1>I don&#39;t believe my comment deserved being shid and cum at. Can you un-cum it?</h1>

<p>Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I put shid back into my butt. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a hot load explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to retaliatory  ejaculation within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of  semen dies before it can fertilize the egg, and yours is likely no  exception.</p>

<h1>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</h1>

<p>Accept  the goopy brown and white substance and move on. But learn from this  mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated in my mom&#39;s basement. I  will continue to shid and cum until you improve your conduct. Remember:  ejaculation is privilege, not a right.</p>
