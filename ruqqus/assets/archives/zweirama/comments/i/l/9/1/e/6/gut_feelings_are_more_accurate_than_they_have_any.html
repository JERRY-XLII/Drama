        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had a friend over and we were playing catch with a football in my front yard. It was fenced with a remote gate and there was a car parked down the street that was giving me bad vibes, even tho random parked cars were normal because my neighborhood was 50% avocado groves and people would steal them. Inevitably, the ball went over the fence.</p>

<p>When I went to hop the fence the car sped towards my house. I unironically expected this, and sprinted 110% to get the ball.</p>

<p>Like 10 minutes later the same car slowly cruised by and the old dude driving gave me the evil eye.</p>

<p>Idk if he raped me in another timeline or what but there&#39;s something paranormal going on here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 90’s we all had that youth football coach that used to touch you and the others players private parts when you score a touchdown... and that is normal when you playing pee wee football ... My coach used to touch me and all my teammates ... they said it was making us more strong,tough, and turning us into men..and I agree with that... I wouldn’t be who I am today if I had not played pee wee football...i used used to score a lot of touchdowns back then and some say i was the star player and the coach really kept an eye on me and loved on me. 90’s was a whole different era and I miss it ..rns</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between talking about the effects of somebody&#39;s actions and talking about their character and motives. <em>Obviously</em>, Trump&#39;s actions have (thus far) had less bad effects than Hitler&#39;s. But what the original poster was saying, and what I think is hard to dispute, is that Hitler was a <em>better man</em> than Trump.</p>
