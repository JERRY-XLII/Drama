<p>&quot;We&quot; as in r/politics users, obviously representing the political majority, need to marginalize the small minority of people (~50% of voters) who are republican.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>holy shit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve thought a great deal about this subject and had written a reply. Here it is with a few more thoughts.</p>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re trying to say but the man said he would create a door to door deportation force, put millions of &quot;Mexicans&quot; on buses and ship them en masse across the border. A door to door deportation force. In the US. He said we should kill the families of terrorists as punishment because they only pretend they don&#39;t care. He said he would send tough sheriffs down to &quot;Chicago&quot; and they&#39;d get crime down super fast if he let them loose and got out of their way. He said he wanted to put all Muslims on a registry and push them to inform on their neighbors. He wanted to ban an entire religion frrom entering the US. He said he had a foolproof plan to defeat ISIS but he&#39;d only share it if he was elected--no matter who would die in the mean time, who would be injured, w/e.</p>

<p>Is it just a mistake or some sort of &quot;economic anxiety&quot; to ignore any one of these? All of them? What kind of moral compass do you have to have to support any, let alone all of that? What kind of person is ok with just some of that if it gets them tax cuts or pisses off &quot;the other team&quot;? Something has to give. None of that turned you (not directly you, of course, but the general person we&#39;re discussing) away from his candidacy? Only after untold scandals, treason, perjury, impeachment, plague, mass unemployment, federal police occupation, and unhidden attempts and election fraud do they suddenly see the light?</p>

<p>In a few years, these people are going to be like the Bush voters who &quot;only voted for him for the first term&quot;. They&#39;ll try and distance themselves from the ramifications of their actions. This country has to have a so-called &quot;come to Jesus moment&quot; about this. We are going to have to make it abundantly clear that this was not acceptable and it had never been. We&#39;re going to need to have people admit they did a bad thing and understand both how stand why they made that error. Because we&#39;ll be dealing with the ramifications of that vote for decades. We&#39;re going to have to spend so much money reconnecting kids with their families, providing counseling, and investigating rampant abuse allegations. We&#39;re going to have to deal with loss of soft power, leaked secrets, and the manipulation of critical institutions and infrastructure. We&#39;re going to have to unbreak whole departments and make new rules barring this ridiculous behavior.</p>

<p>They&#39;re cutting Democrats out of security briefings; they&#39;re dismantling mail sorting machines to stop votes from being counted in battleground states; they&#39;re pushing regulatory capture as SOP; they&#39;re running a spoiler candidate with fake signatures; they&#39;re actively excusing murder of citizens against their political agenda; they still contend that the president is immune from all investigation or prosecution (even giving, in court, the analogy that a president couldn&#39;t be stopped, arrested, or even recorded as part of an investigation for later arrest while in the act of shooting someone on 5th Avenue.) This is not normal. This is not acceptable. This has been going on, in many cases, since the beginning of his term. The breaking point was long ago.</p>

<p>When you screw up on this sort of scale, you don&#39;t get to say sorry and pretend it never happened. We need everyone to understand how a racist demagogue came to power and how to avoid that in the future. We need to head off the more devious, competent, and/or subtle Trump of the future. We&#39;ll never get there if people don&#39;t feel at least the socially negative effects of their mistakes and internalize the lesson about the consequences of their actions. With the knife&#39;s edge we&#39;re on with regards to the basic health of our democracy...honestly...I think if one doesn&#39;t feel full on shame instead of light sheepishness or a social embarrassment, they don&#39;t get it. And the only correct avenue, to me, to correct that (as a functioning democratic country) is with social pressure.</p>

<p>TL;DR Yeah, they can change, but they can&#39;t be allowed to just pretend they didn&#39;t do what they did, especially since we&#39;re going to have to rebuild and repair. They have to understand why they did it and that they have to avoid doing it ever again. Ideally, social pressure would lead to better introspection and at least associating more than just light social embarrassment or annoyance with that act--to the level of shame, even.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just got a really hot take: If 100% of American voters would be r-slurs who are not smarter than a coin, you would basically get election results of about 50% for candidate A and 50% for candidate B. Which is exactly what happens more or less every single election.</p>

<p>But can you blame a coin for voting A? Or can a coin be proud for voting B?</p>
