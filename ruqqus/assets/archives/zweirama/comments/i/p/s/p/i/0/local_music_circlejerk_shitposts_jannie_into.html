    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I should have elaborated. Its not you who&#39;s doing this, its the general mass of the public, and more exemplefied by the &quot;Ben Shapiro Types&quot;. The other guy that responded is sorta correct, but they didn&#39;t explain themself well. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anybody is overtly keeping people from making non-eurocentric music, its about the perception of non-eurocentric, and otherwise progressive music. I live in America, in a generally right-wing area, so I see and hear more often than not, &quot;rap isn&#39;t real music because it doesn&#39;t use music theory,&quot; or &quot;[X artist] isn&#39;t good, because they don&#39;t use music theory&quot; (which may sound reasonable to you, if not, it unfortunately does to many people)</p>

<p>What is taught in America as &quot;music theory&quot; is largely Good 18th Century German Composition according to German Composers of the time. You may be saying, &quot;I don&#39;t see what the problem is with music theory being based on 18th Century German Musical Subjectivism.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, lets replace the first example with that:</p>

<p>Rap isn&#39;t real music because it doesn&#39;t use techniques employed by 18th Century German Musicians.</p>

<p>Its sound odd now, doesn&#39;t it? Many people genuinely use this as an excuse to believe that rap isn&#39;t real music. Notice I said &quot;excuse&quot;, and remember, Music is a very universal topic. Its okay to have subjective taste in music, however, those who say [X] isn&#39;t real music, use that to dehumanize people groups.</p>

<p>When racism occurs, people naturally have empathy for the other race, so in order to excuse their actions, they have to dehumanize the other race (because the average moral code only applies to humans). Before slavery was ended, Black People were 3/5ths human. In the Colonial Context, this often became &quot;civilized&quot; (us) and &quot;uncivilized/savage&quot; (them). Due to the extraordinary racism of the time, it was believed Africans and Native Americans could not have civilization, because their brains were incapable of it, and they were barely human. In Germany, Ashkenazi Jewish, Roma, Gay, and Disabled people were overtly labelled as non-human. Now look at the following logic and see how someone might come up with the conclusion that rap is not music:</p>

<p>1) Music is human 2) Music is defined by &quot;Music Theory&quot; 3) Rap does not use &quot;Music Theory&quot;</p>

<p>Conclusion 1) Rap is not Music Conclusion 2(Subconcious) Modern Black People do not have music, therefore they are less human. </p>

<p>Its not about music made with &quot;music theory&quot;, its not about the &quot;music theory&quot; itself (kinda but thats not the injustice), its about the retroactive application of said &quot;music theory&quot;, where one looks at music and judges it through the lense of 18th Century German Music, that is representative of a larger form of racism. Adam Neely brings on an expert for the very first time to talk about this, not just one of his friends, but a real expert.</p>

<p>I doubt most people even know what the fuck music theory is, boomers who think &quot;rap more like crap&quot; sure as fuck don&#39;t talk about music theory. The only ones who even care about &quot;music theory&quot; are spergs like this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wall of text was written by somebody who apparently kept daydreaming in class and only heard tiny bits of the lecture and filled the rest in with his own nonsense.</p>

<p>The irony is bringing up the 3/5‚Äôs Compromise to say that people legitimately thought blacks to be 3/5‚Äôs human. It is especially funny if you actually had a proper education and realized that it was the <em>slave-owners</em> who were arguing that they did count as full people, for the extra representation.</p>
