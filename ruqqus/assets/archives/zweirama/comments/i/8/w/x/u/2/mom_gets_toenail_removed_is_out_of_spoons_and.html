<p>Lady, you had an ingrown toenail.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I had to have surgery for a broken leg. They had me up and walking on crutches a few hours after I got out of the OR. Laying around feeling sorry for yourself for days really increases your risk of blood clots, in addition to making you a degenerate.</p>

<p>I’m so fucking fed up, I have no spoons. </p>

<p>Ahhh one of the “spoonies” aka people who fetishize their supposed illnesses</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The past month my mental health has tanked due to an autoimmune disease I’m dealing with, I’ve been getting rolling panic attacks that are debilitating but I put a brave face on for my family and do all the shit we need. Last week I had a night where I sat in our room and cried and didn’t even know why, got it together and ate dinner like nothing happened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That poor husband having to deal with an adult child. I can’t imagine how dramatic she is in real life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few days after I had to have an ingrown toenail removed and had a weird complication in which the anesthetic did NOT fucking wear off. It’s a week later and I still can’t even bend my toe properly and the first several days meant being bed bound and not coming downstairs because I couldn’t walk. My husband on the first day in bed even asked me in an exasperated tone asked me when this would be done....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like he’s had enough</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today my foot is feeling so much better, came downstairs and while in the kitchen I could smell the kitty litter and I said in passing, “wow that stinks”. We alternate who changes it on the weekends and husband says “well it’s been your turn.”................... I said he should have changed it because I practically had toe surgery and couldn’t even come downstairs like come on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitch you had an ingrown toenail removed, not your gallbladder</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What. The. Fuck. This turned into a fight because “its fiiine” but I should have told him to do it, or while recovering from my toe surgery I should have told him I also wouldn’t be making dinner or wouldn’t be eating with the family so he could prepare things. And the best line “if it was my toe then I would still be doing things, but because it’s your toe you can’t do anything.” There was also words spoken about him working remote and having to get up and deal with our toddler for 2hrs or part of the day because I couldn’t. Meanwhile, I had been applying for jobs and have someone wanting to set up an interview for a remote job (full time, 8-5am at $50k) and confided in him that I don’t feel like I’m in a stable enough point with my health or mental health to do it. He kept encouraging me because of the money and that I should at least attempt the interview. I have 2 days left to schedule it and this whole conversation is making me want to delete the email now. Apparently I can barely be a SAHM, how am I supposed to work full time and be a SAHM? Everything always falls on my shoulders with the duties and sacrifices. I’m so fed up. 😭</p>
