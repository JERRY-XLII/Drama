        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I moved into this new apartment a few years back. It‚Äôs like a cliche ‚Äúnew family moves to suspiciously cheap house‚Äù. It‚Äôs at a very nice location, it‚Äôs spacious and the owner even left expensive furniture with it. What could go wrong?</p>

<p>I would get nightmares almost every night for a few months straight. It was odd because I am a lucid dreamer and I haven‚Äôt had a scary nightmare that continuously since I was like 12 because I was almost always in control. Another thing was I rarely dreamed of new places immediately unless I stayed there for quite some time.</p>

<p>I kept dreaming that this crazy lady would come out of one of the rooms at this new apartment and she would just try to kill me. The oddest part was I didn‚Äôt wake up when I was being killed. Most dreams you would wake up from shock when you get killed but not these ones. I could feel her stabbing me over and over again. It was terrifying.</p>

<p>To add salt to the wound I would feel like something just walking past me when I‚Äôm sitting at my desk but I‚Äôm inside my room and there‚Äôs no one but me. My first reaction was I had been hallucinating. It‚Äôs probably stress. So, I ignored them. I tested for CO2 levels and checked for mold. It‚Äôs well ventilated anyway. So windy that the doors will slam shut sometimes.</p>

<p>I was terrified for a while but things died down for weeks and I brushed it off on stress again. The nightmares were gone but one night, I woke up to pee and when I came back to my room and got in bed, someone was standing at the foot of my bed. A dark figure looking at me. I closed my eyes, opened and looked again but it‚Äôs gone. I brushed it off as half awake sleep paralysis type thing. I went back to sleep.</p>

<p>Still I did not believe in any of it. This is my first time moving and I watched a lot of horror movies. So, that must be it.</p>

<p>Then, I met the tenants who were previously renting and staying at this apartment and I jokingly told them this place was haunted. They got quiet and asked me if I wasn‚Äôt scared. I answered no because it‚Äôs true. I was scared during the scary moments but overall, I managed to live through it. They said they didn‚Äôt want to say anything at first because they didn‚Äôt want to scare me but they had also experienced crazy shit like not being able to open doors (still using the same doors and they are all fine for me). Things moving in front of them. That‚Äôs why they left and the owner couldn‚Äôt get anyone to rent here for long. That‚Äôs why they decided to sell it.</p>

<p>Things have been going fine since then because at least I now know it‚Äôs not just me experiencing weird shit. I still feel the presence sometimes but I just ignore it. Oh, I still get the terrifying nightmares sometimes but nowhere near as frequent as it used to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to be the gatekeeper but thats pretty much nothing. I lived in a legitimately haunted house from 8 to 13.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saw my future self in the mirror wearing clothes my mom hadn&#39;t bought for me yet.</p>

<p>heard my dad creaming for help all the time only to come to his office, either he wasn&#39;t home or wasn&#39;t screaming for me</p>

<p>I would up at 6am on the dot all the time in the morning especially on weekends (parents had no weekend alarm and woke up at 7 on weekdays</p>

<p>my mom would see her dead father watching her all the time</p>

<p>saw my cat in my room with the lights off pawing to be let out, let her out and she went downstairs, I went to the bathroom as well and when I looked at the hallway my cat was actually in front of my parents room (who was cat?)</p>

<p>one day there was a tropical storm outside i came home from school at like 330 since my parents were at work was home alone. The second I walked in the door I heard a woman wailing upstairs and shrieking like she was being tortured. I went outside and waited for an hour and a half ruining all my books in my backpack until my parents got home.</p>

<p>my brothers birthday balloon followed me around the house for a day when I was home alone, going under door frames and shit when I wasn&#39;t looking</p>

<p>woke up and my enormous heavy bed had been moved to the opposite side of my room blocking my door while I was asleep and my parents were trying to get in</p>

<p>Thats all I can remember for now</p>
