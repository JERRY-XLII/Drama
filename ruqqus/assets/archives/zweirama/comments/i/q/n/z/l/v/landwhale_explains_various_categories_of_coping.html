    <div class="md"><p>sorry to be a party pooper, jihad does not mean a religious war, it means a struggle within oneself to strive for both holyness and forgiveness, through charity and good deeds, not murdering infidels or whatever. however, al-harb al muqaddasah DOES mean holy war, and its never used by any calipha or sheik, because we believe only god can decide if somethings holy or not</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>I feel strongly against that word when its written in english, its meaning got so mangled and destroyed by the orientalist scopes of western media, we&#39;ve been painted as savages who will massacre anyone that breaths unless they accept allah, I&#39;m genuinely done with that bullshit, I&#39;ve been both trained with and was commanded by american troops while training, i most likely will do so again soon after this covid things blows away, but being the only one in my unit speaking proper english makes me the diplomat in every scenario, either a friend will tell me what the american is trying to say or the american will just approach me and talk to me like a servant, their ceaseless racism is super fucking disgusting, whenever they ask for something they think i don&#39;t speak english so they&#39;ll say shit like &quot;hey camel fucker, come here, you english? english english? huh? no no you have english?&quot;, sometimes its far worse, hell one time someone who i assume to be an american cadet began raising his voice when an arab officer told him that hes not going to the infirmary for the 3rd time, first 2 times he wasn&#39;t diagnosed with anything and was fucking around, his resposne? , he yelled &quot;go fuck yourself sand ni-----&quot;, he wen&#39;t to the infirmary, stayed there for awhile infact, he fucked with a fucking gulf war vet who just so happened to outrank every single american officer present, this has gone too long, what i&#39;m trying to say is please don&#39;t use that word unless its in the correct context, the west, specially americans, have become extremely anti-muslim, if they see a muslim woman, they become defensive and try to &quot;liberate her&quot;, if they see a muslim man, hes suddenly the representative to the whole muslim community and therefore must pay with his blood for any terrorist masquerading as a muslim, muslims don&#39;t believe in holy wars, only normal wars, we don&#39;t lie to ourselves and say god wants us to kill the enemy, we merely wish for god to have mercy upon their souls and ride on</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 6 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

Most swear words used on reddit are for emphatic swearing, basically swearing to emphasize the fucking point. Because Reddit is not a serious environment, this is the place to express yourself, to express your views and opinions  with everyone, and a place of fun and relaxed discussion, this is not a fucking school, nor is it a fucking business meeting, you fucking brainless spineless motherfucking snowflakey cuntfucker. Even if there was an argument, budging in to spam it is never going to help anything, it just makes the argument worse and the hate directed to you, you even spam on therapy subreddits and trauma subs for fucks sake, I made this bot out of nothing but pure hatred and annoyance of you, who gave you the right to dictate what I can say? Why does it matter to you to constantly harass and annoy others purely based on your snowflake judgements? Why do you not delete yourself?
