        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;d  never do that because I am genuinely in love with Anne Frank. She was  beautiful, witty, and   graceful young woman who light was snuffed out  far too early.</p>

<p>I frequently fantasize about being Peter van Pels hiding with her.</p>

<p>Oh    god, just imagine deflowering that sweet girl on a lazy Amsterdam    afternoon, lying and learn what each other&#39;s bodies were for.</p>

<p>Now    imagine nine months later, she&#39;s got a massive bulging stomach from    carrying your child inside of her and it seems like she’s gonna pop any    moment now. Her popped belly button makes it look like she&#39;s got a   giant  third boob where her stomach once was. She waddles around and can    barely move half of the time. She&#39;s developed an insatiable craving   for  your dick and you&#39;ve likewise developed a taste for her pussy.   You’re  both cooped up in an attic all day have nothing better to do   besides  fuck like an unsustainable third world population. You lie down   on your  back, she strips off her almost comically too small clothes   and kneels  on top of you. She grabs a hold of your rock hard cock,   inserts it deep  inside of her, and begins to ride you like a stallion.   You feel the  pressure from her incredible weight and huge round belly   bearing down on  you but the indescribable pleasure of her tight pussy   throbbing on you  cock negates any discomfort. You sink into her   beautiful soul, into that  secret place where no one dares to go. After   30 minutes, you and her  are both moaning with ever greater intensity,   you know it won&#39;t be long  now. Suddenly, you feel your cock shaking   like a V-2 rocket and the  orgasm reaches it&#39;s climax as your cum   literally explodes like an 88mm  AT round inside her Sherman tank,   blowing the turret right off. You and  her both join as one, souls   screaming from the sheer ecstasy. As the  elation wears off, she lies   next to you. Too exhausted to do anything  else, you simply hold her in   your embrace. In that moment, there is no  family squabbles, no Nazis,   no war. Just you and her, watching the sky  turn pink with the setting   sun.</p>

<p>You dream of the beautiful face you have found in this place. So soft and sweet.</p>

<p>One    day you will both die and your ashes will fly from an aeroplane over    the sea. But for now you are young and all you want is lay in the sun,    and count every beautiful thing you can see. Love to be in the arms  of   all you’re keeping here with you.</p>

<p>What a beautiful dream that could flash on the screen in a blink of an eye.</p>

<p>Suddenly,    you awaken from your slumber to the sound of a bloodcurdling scream.    You open your eyes to darkness, it takes a split second for your  vision   to readjust. You feel lonely and cold. Another shriek knocks  you back   into reality. Anne sitting next to you, clutching her belly,  face   contorted from pain. A foul smelling fluid lies pooled on the  floor   around her mid-section. Your hot dirty fuckfest has brought on  labor.   she cries your name, begging for help, begging for you. The  noise. She’s   louder than a line of Louisiana Tigers giving the Rebel  Yell right  now.  You raise your finger to your lips to tell her to be  quiet. But  the  agony is too much for her to bear. You’ve got to do  something or  else it  will awaken the entire neighborhood and with it,  the Nazis.  Suddenly  you remember the bulge in your pants. You’ve got  morning wood.  It’s not  the best gag, but it will have to do. You stand  up, squat  like a slav,  using her belly as an impromptu stool, grab  your still  cum-crusted cock,  and shove it right inside her mouth. At  first, she  tries to scream even  louder in surprise, but your  circumcised 100%  Kosher dong blocks her  windpipe, reducing her screams  to a barely  audible gurgle. Suffering  from unbearable pain, she bites  down on her  your meat with each  contraction. Now you’e in pain too.  With each  contraction, she bites  down harder, it feels like she’s  gonna tear your  cock right off.  Eventually, the pain subsides for her  and she doesn’t  bite down as much.  Now it seems almost as if she’s  starting to enjoy  it. You can feel your  child kick on your testicles.  Clearly it’s  excited too. Suddenly, your  cock starts to shake like a  V-2 again, you  pull it out of her mouth just  in time. You bust your  steaming hot and  sticky load, blanketing her  like an incendiary  carpetbombing of  Dresden. Semen stains her  mountaintops (all three of  them), along with  her hair and most of her  face. She quietly giggles  from the ironic  amusement of it all. You  giggle too.</p>

<p>Then   a look of sharp  pain shoot across her face. She’s having your baby.   You wish you could  bear all the pain for her, but all you can do is sit   and watch. You look  down at her vulva, still oozing with cum from  that  great fucking you  gave her a few hours ago. You can see a head of   black hair poking out.  You fear that she’s gonna start screaming  again,  much to your relief, it  seems that she’s gotten better control  of the  pain, thanks to you. She  begins to softly moan, it seems as if  instead  of experiencing  excruciating agony, she’s experiencing an  orgasm. You  can’t help but  grin as she keeps pushing. As more of the  head becomes  visible, her  moaning intensifies. Finally a small head  emerges from her  vagina. You  can see a face wrapped in an umbilical  cord. A small pair  of hands grab  the head, she weakly tries to pull  the head out. You put  your hands  around the head and begin to help her  pull. Desperately, she  goes into  the next contraction with all of her  energy, and pushed with  everything  inside of her. She feels  everything. She feels shoulders  and hips and  feet all slide down  inside of her and pop out in one long  push, with a  rush of fluid  behind it, and it feels amazing. She throws  her head back  with a  rip-roaring orgasm that penetrates the very heart  of her soul.</p>

<p>You   look at the  newborn now lying on the floor and see that it is a boy.   You have a  son. Perfect, perfect in every way. He begins to stir and  you  realize  he’s about to cry. After all that’s happened, you don’t to   given away  to the Germans from the wails of a newborn. You gently  lift  him up and  place him on Anne’s semen stained mountaintops. The  baby  quickly finds  the breast is soon sucking happily. Semen, blood,  amniotic  fluid,  breastmilk all mix and fill the air with a strange  scent that  while  repulsive, is also extremely arousing. You can’t  resist the urge   anymore. Your mouth land on top of Anne’s opposite  breast, sucking first   your own cum, but then her tasty milk. You look  into her eyes, she’s   somewhat annoyed, but too exhaust to really care.  A gust of wind coming   from a hole in the wall blows through, cooling  both of your   sweat-drenched bodies, but also disturbing the little  one. You’re afraid   he’ll start shivering. You look around the dusty  attic for something  to  keep the baby warm. You settle on Anne’s fur  winter jacket, having  sat  unused for the past two years. You know Anne  will definitely not be   happy that you ruined her favorite coat, but  it’s for the best. She   hasn’t been able to fit in it for the past nine  months anyway. You   carefully wrap your little one in the coat and  hand him to an exhausted   Anne, she continues to quietly feed him. You  notice the dead silence  for  the first time, not even the other  occupants of the Annex, mere  feet  away in the next room, were roused.  You feel a sense of relief.  You’re  safe, for the moment at least.  Eventually you curl up next to  her  quietly and begin to doze off. Your  secret sleeps in winter  clothes.  Tomorrow, you can find a way to  explain the night’s events to  your  parents and hope they don’t kill  each other. You can somehow find a  way  to get your little bundle of  joy to safety. But tonight, you just  rest,  your first night as a  family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my country, during german occupation, you could snitch on jews then steal their stuff between the time they got arrested and the time the germans would show up to loot their places. Or if you snitched enough the local authorities might straight up let you move into their house while they took a train ride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just downvoted your comment.</p>

<p>FAQ</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.</p>

<p>Why did you do this?</p>

<p>There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<p>• Rudeness towards other Redditors,</p>

<p>• Spreading incorrect information,</p>

<p>• Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.</p>

<p>Am I banned from the Reddit?</p>

<p>No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?</p>

<p>Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</p>

<p>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</p>

<p>Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.</p>
