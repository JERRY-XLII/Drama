    <div class="md"><p>~for those of you who don&#39;t know~</p>

<p>Anthony Cumia (of Opie &amp; Anthony fame) is so racist that he had a hobby of driving into Manhattan on friday nights and filming/photographing black prostitutes, which they don&#39;t like apparently. </p>

<p>Well in July 2014 he snaps several photos of this hooker in the OP at 4 in the morning, and she starts beating him up. 3 or 4 black guys notice this happening, and they start beating him up as well. The photo in the OP is a pic he took that fateful night. </p>

<p>Anthony escapes with his life, and goes home, gets blackout drunk, logs into twitter, and posts hundreds of racist ranting tweets. The following monday he is fired from Sirius XM. This was in 2014 and Anthony currently hosts a podcast that has a triple-digit audience of fellow degenerate racists and is produced by a corrupt cop who was fired from the NYPD for corruption. All of this is true. </p>

<p>Oh and in 2015 Anthony beat the shit out of his live-in prostitute &#39;girlfriend&#39; in a domestic violence incident. She&#39;s 1/3rd his age, and he broke her hand, broke her ribs, strangled her, and bit (!) her. He went to jail but didn&#39;t see prison time because he&#39;s rich. </p>

<p>Also his brother Joe is the stupidest person you could ever hope to meet. He is unemployed and his only discernible activity in life is to defend his brother Anthony (from whom he earns a stipend). He has running battles with redditors and people on twitter and Kiwi farms, etc. he constantly googles his name and Anthony&#39;s name, and I guarantee you he will contact me because of this post, and attempt to DMCA/dox me. Joe has a fuckable daughter who wears a training bra. I know you&#39;re reading this, Joe. I&#39;m going to fuck Layla. </p>

<p>FINALLY, and unrelated, Anthony&#39;s cohost Jim Norton is gay, and recently tried to marry a man from Iceland, but the Icelandic dude couldn&#39;t enter the US because he&#39;s a criminal and has AIDS, lmao</p>
