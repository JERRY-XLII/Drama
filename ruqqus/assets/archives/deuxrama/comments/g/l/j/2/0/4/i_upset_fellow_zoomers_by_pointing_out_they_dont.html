    <div class="md"><p>Universities are shit and you can learn most degrees by yourself or online. But unless you get that paper most jobs are out of your reach, specially in Europe where you better have a degree to be even a blue collar worker. You&#39;ll also find that universities are monopolies in a way, and receive state power. That&#39;s why they are so expensive, their personal overpaid, extremely entitled and receive more and more money from the state: even if you didn&#39;t go to college, you&#39;re still paying for everyone else</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said most, my brother is studying mechanical engineering and spends like 15 hours I a week in lab. And you learn most from internships. Econometrics was the only difficult subject in my career and I learned more self studying and fiddling with R than by simply going to class. Most of my classes were reading a PowerPoint, giving an explanation and doing examples. You could see all that in a video. The most useful things I got from unuversity were: an internship and commentary by certain teachers who worked on the private sector and how to apply certain concepts (all that knowledge could&#39;ve been condensed into 3 hour videos per subject)</p>

<p>obviously i can&#39;t comb through 1200 schools, but there&#39;s probably one that meets your requirements, unless your major/plan is really rare.</p>

<p>seriously. you genuinely don&#39;t have to take any of these exams if you don&#39;t want to. i don&#39;t know where this idea came from - probably advertising + the general brainwashing that comes with education - that if you don&#39;t take these exams you&#39;re screwed somehow.</p>
