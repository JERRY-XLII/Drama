    <div class="md"><p>My posts are demand-influenced. People feel the need to positively influence themselfes from others. The idiot is a part of the social system and as such has a vital part to play in society as he provides the chance for others to look down on him as he&#39;s doing such idiotic things. The internet has desensitised the general public. Someone whos erratically yelling things isn&#39;t as off-putting as it used to be when the village idiot was doing that job. People demand weird content that is crossing the boarders of social norms. People putting their bathroom usage on social media seem to be what people want to see. Actually, they are weird, much weirder than most of the other content here. As you can see, this content gets upvoted. You may not like it, but this content is satisfying the need for which people come to this subreddit.</p>

<p>people are supposed to be allowed to shoot someome becsuse they suspected that they trespassed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t suspect it, they knew and saw it. Listen to the 911 call. They saw him do it and reported him to the police. If you actually read georgia law you&#39;ll find the case will hinge on whether or not the citizens arrest is justifiable and it absolutely is. Burglary is a felony so the arrest can go through, seeing someone trespass onto a site is the vicinity and immediate knowledge of a crime happening, burglary, while not being witnessed directly is a reasonable and probable inference resulting from said knowledge. Basically every individual part of the law is met. </p>

<p>On a side note, you absolutely should be able to shoot someone who is trespassing on private property. Dont wanna get shot then dont come into private property, or better yet dont try to fight the guy putting you in a citizens arrest just because you broke the law and got caught. You keep ignoring the citizens arrest for a reason, he would have been alive and in police custody if he hadnt tried to run and or kill an upstanding citizen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sounds civilized bro</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah we should look up to the civilized English where if a burglar injures himself trying to break into your home you need to pay them for the privilege of almost being made a victim of a crime. Truly that is a much better and more civilized lifestyle, forcing would be victims or victims themselves to pay for the medical bills of a criminal that would have directly victimized them.</p>

<p>There was literally no reason to assault the men with guns either. Keep sucking jogger dick faggot but his actions are indefensible. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he wasnt a threat to anyone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for that one time where he tried to shoot up a high school basketball game and the hammer he stole being potentially used as a weapon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if they really wanted to make sure he didn&#39;t get away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then cornering him with firearms to get him to submit works. Following a guy who is running and can run faster than you is riskier than &quot;FREEZE! GET THE FUCK DOWN I HAVE A GUN!&quot;</p>

<p>If what you&#39;re saying is true then explain why police dont just follow a criminal until some other cop can block his path ahead of him. Cops make an arrest with their gun out because its a deterrent for them to run. Its easier to run away when a threat to your life isnt there.</p>

<p>Go fuck off to r/BBCLovers or some shit where you belong. Criminal retard did retarded shit and won retarded prizes. The only tragedy here is these poor guys being slandered and jailed for literally being the greatest neighbors out there.</p>

<p>how is it self defense when they went out of their way to threaten him with guns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An arrest is not a threat, if it was then every criminal who kills a police officer mid arrest is justified in doing so. Its easy to answer if you&#39;re not retarded. Say i break into your home and you try to corner me with a knife after calling the police so they arrest me. I instead decide to punch you and try to wrestle the knife from you.  Is it self defense for you to stab me? Is it reasonable to assume you will literally die if i get my hands on the knife? Of course it is. </p>

<p>If this criminal jogga didn&#39;t wanna die then he should have listened to what the men with guns said and waited for cops to show up. If all he did was trespass hed have gotten off with a misdemeanor at worst but then again, this guy tried to shoot up a high school basketball game and has a history of mental illness and burglary so maybe those priors would have sent his ass longer.</p>

<p>A civilized society jails its criminals, a retarded one will defend a criminal and villify neighborhood heroes who defend their community.</p>

<p>They weren’t cops, just random rednecks. We don’t if they even good reason to believe that Arbery committed a felony.</p>

<p>A civilized society has a justice system and law enforcement, it doesn’t let their citizens act like vigilantes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but the media did one good thing: brought it to center stage so actual justice could be had. If you don’t agree that he ACTUALLY didn’t do anything I 110% recommend Collion Noir’s video on it.
