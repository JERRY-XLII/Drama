        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>being that this sub is widely considered to be the most intellectually based place on the internet full of experts on all matters great and small including one Ted Kaczynski what better place to ask questions on uncle Ted&#39;s seminal work.</p>

<p>Deuxchads, we all have read and discussed what is widely considered the most important piece of writing since arguably the Quran an industrial society and it&#39;s future. As we know Imam Ted theorized that in fact industrial society was the worst thing to happen to humanity. This was a solid argument but my question is did he take the foid menace into consideration when writing this manifesto. I believe he did not as if he did I believe he would have recognized giving foids the vote ended up being far more damaging to humanity then even industrialization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Foids always will be a “burden” for sure, but they are also essential in creating great men. I mean this not only literally but also in a nurturing manner. A great father can only do so much, he has to provide, and there’s only so much time in a day. I’d wager he would point out that the industrial revolution made it easier/possible for foids to enter the workplace (thus empowering them). Before industrialization, they had to stay at home, otherwise they wouldn’t survive economically or in a literal sense. You could flip his views on the power process to a more feminine focus and easily conclude that women are being deprived of the nurture process natural to them. This is evident especially today, foids are ignoring their natural tendency towards hypergamy to sell nudes and receive male attention through the internet. At the end of the day what does a thot really get out of any of that? </p>

<p>That’s just what I’d conclude based off of reading his manifesto. The whole suffrage vs industry question is more of a chicken and egg deal.</p>
