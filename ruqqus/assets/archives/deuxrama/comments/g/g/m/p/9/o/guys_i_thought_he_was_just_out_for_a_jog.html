<p>Are you actually blind or simply blinded by leftoid ideology? The black boi literally tried to wrestle the shotgun away from him while trying to beat him. It&#39;s captured on video, there is no disputing this. He only fired on the black boi in self-defense. How can you possibly dispute this?</p>

<p>The firearms weren&#39;t even aimed at the black boi until he started attacking. They were well within the confines of the law at all times during this encounter.</p>

<p>No it does not. It is perfectly legal to open carry</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Attacking someone who is not aiming a firearm at you and violently trying to wrestle it away by punching them repeatedly is not self-defense. The black boi chimped out and fucked up big time son. No wonder the heroic neighborhood watchman shot him in self defense, if the black boi had got that gun who knows how many he would have shot and killed. Remember, he was identified by one of the McMichaels for a prior case, he would likely have known of the black bois history with firearms and mental illness!</p>

<p>No they&#39;re going to be let out free and hopefully have a big fund raised for them when they do so they can live their lives peacefully as they intended before the violent black boi terrorized their neighborhood!</p>

<p>untrue. the law is clear. you&#39;re wrong. they have to WITNESS a felony in order to make a citizens arrest. trespassing is what they (maybe) witnessed. not a felony. strike 1</p>

You don&#39;t deserve to exist in the same Galaxy as us. Scratch that- the same universe as us. Scratch that- the same existence as us. 
But your puny little mind probably thinks that there&#39;s one universe. If you watch Joe Rogan you would know that there&#39;s multiple. 
But you don&#39;t, and I can see that. You&#39;re just missing out on everyone from Elon Musk to Jesus himself having the greatest
