<p>Oh man hahaha. How is is that these people manage to put EVERY SINGLE PERSON they dislike in the same basket. It&#39;s so ironic considering this is something racists do all the time (judging every single person in a group as if they were one monolith).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>White people are killed all the time by other white people too, literally the white person response is to grab innocent blacks and lynch them and slander them and shame people into accepting the story. This what primitive, backwards southern culture believes restores it&#39;s honor. It&#39;s truly pathetic. Nobody destroyed the honor of the south besides your own barbarism and persistence in this behavior. When images like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Lynching_of_Jesse_Washington%2C_1916.jpg">these</a> were release you briefly relented, but of course you were truly angry at the people who released them and so dishonored you, you were not ashamed of yourselves for murdering innocent people you didn&#39;t care about simply to look &quot;based&quot; and &quot;tough&quot; and restore your backwards honor.</p>

<p>Those people in the crowd smiling, they felt just as disgusted and revolted as I do now, in fact far more than I do because they were there, many of them had PTSD and nightmares afterward for the rest of their life. They doubt the guilt of the victim just as much as I do. They smile because they&#39;re weak, they know they will be shamed if they do not project an image of sociopathy and cruelty required to uphold the purpose of the ritual among their sociopathic society, their reputation, their honor. They knew the only result of pointing out the paucity of evidence would be being shamed; for undermining confidence in the ritual of scapegoating, and potentially dishonoring their society and it&#39;s precious <em>reputation</em>, the thing about <em>reputation</em> is that it does not care about <em>truth</em> or <em>reality</em>, it is ingenuine. </p>

<p>I know how that society is, I know it&#39;s culture, I was born and am trapped in it to this day.  I hate their honor, and my goal in life is to destroy it utterly, by destroying it utterly, it is the only way they can be saved and redeemed. The only way to atone for the sins of the ancestors, is to make them right and cease to build them.</p>

<p>Exactly how people felt going to the collesium in rome and executions in Europe. </p>

<p>No, they hate blacks and they&#39;re happy when a black is killed. Stop projecting your fragility onto people 100 years in the past, kinda, no very cringe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He literally had a gun pointed in his face, if he had pulled out a gun and shot the other guy, wouldn&#39;t it have been stand your ground lmao? But because instead he was unarmed and tried to push the gun out of his face, it was self-defense by the person who walked up to a random person on the street and pulled a gun on them. LMAO. The black guy was supposed to freeze? Why? Do white men have special white men authority to walk up to people and point guns at them and they&#39;re legally required to freeze? Usually you would classify walking up to a person and pointing a gun at them as &quot;assault&quot;, that would be in non-rightist land.</p>

<p>Again, none of you believe he had done anything anymore than I did, you merely want it to be believed that he did because that&#39;s of utility to you, in restoring your white person honor. That&#39;s the entire purpose of lynching in a primitive honor based society, honor doesn&#39;t actually care about the truth, it cares about appearances. Actually killing a person responsible is not relevant to restoring honor, all that is relevant is that it appear and widely be believed to be the case. </p>

<p>The reason these videos frustrate you is precisely because it destroys your entire honor based caste system and reveals the poison at the core of your rotten culture. Evidence is the enemy of an honor and scapegoating based society, people who spread truth are the enemy who undermine your &quot;badass&quot; and &quot;tough&quot; social image that you project by killing and framing unarmed niggers. That is the most important thing to you. You don&#39;t actually believe he&#39;s guilty, I know this for a fact lmao, you know it as well as I even as you click the downvote button and cover your screen in spit furiously typing your angry reply.</p>

<p>No but fr, wtf are you on about. They were running down a burglary suspect, the suspect tried to fight them, they shot him. Do you think black people aren&#39;t killed in other countries? Do you think they don&#39;t cut off thieves hands in other countries?</p>

<p>Can you name a single white person that was unjustly killed by blacks?</p>

<p>Are you aware that we treat blacks and browns with kid gloves because the racially tolerant whites view them as lower class citizens? Do you realize telling kids about white privilege is installing a race based caste system they cant escape from?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thats not an honest portrayal of the situation. This wasn&#39;t a random person on the street, this was them performing a citizens arrest. The suspect tried to fight them. Like I already said in this thread, if some blacks came up to me with a gun, because I was robbing their neighborhood (Lol imagine), I would stop , not try to fight them with my hands. Maybe because I have a developed prefrontal cortex?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I assure you, watching armed robbery get killed does not frustrate me in the slightest. Its sad it came to that, but why did he run around the car and get right into their face like an idiot?</p>

<p>Its more frustrating to see king lebron, worth millions upon millions, tell people that blacks are hunted down daily. Ya... who&#39;s killing them again? Gang-bangers. Thats what I want to see addressed, but thats wishful thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The road was the white people&#39;s property? Oh wow I didn&#39;t know that part of the story my friendo. </p>

<p>You <em>never</em> posses the right to confront a person in a public place who is not committing a crime at the time, and who you have not actually witnessed committing a crime, with a gun drawn. If you do that, they have a right to defend themselves. If they pull a gun back on you and shoot you, <em>that</em> would be self defense. If they grab your gun in the struggle and shoot, you, <em>that</em> would also also be self defense. If during the struggle you are victorious and shoot them, <em>that</em> is murder. If they freeze and comply, <em>that</em> is assault. It is not possible in this situation for them to be the aggressor.</p>

<p>He matched the description of somebody reported to have engaged in crimes? There had actually not been any reported burglaries in the neighborhood in the previous months, probably should have done that, then it wouldn&#39;t just look like your buddies making up an alibi for you. Also what did the description consist of? &quot;Black male&quot;? So if any person who matches this sophisticated description, &quot;black male&quot;, had in fact been jogging suddenly people have the right to chase them down in trucks and point guns at them and if they fail to comply with requests, it&#39;s self defense to shoot them. OK, so apparently black people in or around the jurisdiction had lost all rights at that time, that&#39;s OK I guess since it only applies to black people. </p>

<p>FYI, this is usually why it&#39;s a <em>requirement</em> to provide descriptions more elaborate than the race of the suspect, can you at least throw out a guess at the height or something so that you have not rendered the entire area a constitution free zone for any members of a certain race.</p>

<p>White people are always so furious and angry any time a sacrifice is asked to be made on their part, but they are always extremely quick to expect a sacrifice on the part of others. Almost eager. You don&#39;t care, because you are asking a sacrifice that will never apply to you, and that&#39;s all that matters. What I ask, if a sacrifice is not to much to be asked of black people, it is not to much to be asked of you either. We should <em>not</em> allow you to get away with imposing sacrifices on the backs of black people that don&#39;t apply to you, of course that seems easy and reasonable to you. </p>

<p>If something applies to black people, it should apply to me and all others to, I refuse to receive or allow for any exemptions on the part of these sacrifices for me or anyone else in society. If you reasonably stop and frisk black people, you should stop and frisk me and all other white people too, only then can we absolutely be sure the motivation is actually about fighting crime, rather than pushing off the sacrifice onto someone else. Rightists are obsessed with pushing off the sacrifice on to someone else, &quot;make Mexico pay for it&quot;, just pathetic, I hate this sort of scab, snitch behavior. It&#39;s the lowest form of behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Better yet use violence on a random innocent black person even if you don&#39;t actually know who it, then have a corrupt legal system that bends over and claims he was totes the guy and it was self-defense, so that it gets in the news that people in your community murder people over property and aren&#39;t a bunch of betas, so that you&#39;ve restored the honor of the community and scared off burglars in the future even though you don&#39;t actually know who did it. This way you can avoid the dishonor that would come from waiting for an actual investigation to complete and the possibility that nothing would occur if it wasn&#39;t clear from the evidence who did it, which would be the real tragedy You&#39;ve <em>got</em> to kill someone*, might as well go grab a nigger. </p>

<p>Of course that&#39;s grand strategy until the point in time where the video is released and it&#39;s clear that you pretty much just picked out the nearest nigger you can find and walked up to him with your gun drawn and pointed at his face looking for an excuse to shoot. Then in fact your community just looks like a bunch of crazed bloodthirsty savages and murderers. The important thing at this point is to not stop the propaganda war, here, again, all that matters is what people see the issue is. </p>

<p>Badger them on it enough and try to get the people of weak will to cave, the liberals, eventually they will cave and begin accepting or at least not fighting your version of the account. Never at any point simply cease this social practice; that would be defeat, that would be dishonor, reputation is all that matters, not innocence or truth. The actual reality of things, the genuineness, that is irrelevant, beat the genuine out of people, beat the doubt out of them, so that the ritual serves its purpose.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t make that up. It was a big thing with cat memes on Instagram. I think it&#39;s from a quora post or something where someone was asking about giving their cat people food and people ran with it because it&#39;s absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK, but it&#39;s been admitted that he was burglarizing homes in the area.</p>

<p>At this point, these guys are guaranteed to get off for the crime. The victim had just finished burgling a neighbor, he had a history of violent crime, and he was the first to attack two people who can plausibly claim that they were trying to make a citizen&#39;s arrest. Were they? Probably not. Probably they had heard about burglaries in the area (contrary to what redditors think, most people don&#39;t bother reporting burglary as there is almost no possibility of regaining lost property, so there is rarely a well-established record of such things) and saw someone black who they didn&#39;t know. But they can plausibly claim it now since there&#39;s reportedly video of him robbing a neighbor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We wouldn&#39;t hear about this because he&#39;d be in prison right now lol</p>

<p>Lmao imagine a black guy just walking up to someone and pulling a gun on them and expecting the law to be on their side, lmao that&#39;s hilarious. Only white people have special white people authority that means if they point a gun at you your legally obligated to freeze, and if you attempt to defend yourself it was self defense to shoot you. Like I think a white robber can walk up to a black guy too and pull a gun on them, it&#39;s only a robbery if the black guy freezes long enough to learn it&#39;s a robbery and hear that he should hand over his stuff. If he just immediately begins to defend himself, he&#39;s officially resisting white people arrest, he hadn&#39;t had it made clear at that point it was a robbery and not a white person arrest, and legally a white person arrest is assumed I think.</p>

<p>Depends on what they told him, doesn&#39;t it? If they told him to stop and wait for the police and that they are making a citizen arrest then he must wait till the cops prove he didn&#39;t commit whatever they suspect he committed.
If they told him to get into their van, that they have free <del>candy</del> sneakers for him or to put his hands up because it&#39;s a robbery, that would be an entirely different story.</p>

<p>LOL I&#39;m not sure what would I tell them about guys with weapons, but I would certainly teach them not to have a criminal history and not to go jogging 10 miles from their home and trespass on strangers property as if they are checking it for stuff to steal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You might want to check a dictionary for the word brandishing. While we don&#39;t know for sure what the shotgun guy did and whether he even raised his shotgun before Arbery charged at him, we know the van guy had his right hand by his side and only grabbed the revolver some time after the struggle over the shotgun began.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t 10 miles from his home, that&#39;s a fake fact. He was 15 minutes from his neighbourhood. Also according to Georgia&#39;s law, he wasn&#39;t even trespassing so big L for you lmao </p>

<p>Okay maybe I used brandishimg wrong but they were visibly armed (especially the shot gun guy who was holding hit in both hands) and they had no grounds to make a citizens arrest because the probable cause was so weak</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know that. If he went in to steal and only left because there was nothing to steal it was trespassing. Even if it wouldn&#39;t been possible to prove. Anyway that&#39;s not why they stopped him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So all he had to do, was wait for the cops and then leave a free man or even sue them for being raycis and threatening him with guns. Now he&#39;s dead and worst thing that can happen to the two guys who killed him is manslaughter sentence. And I doubt they&#39;ll get 20 years even if they are convicted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no source about the reports of him wearing boots and having a hammer on his person, if you do a search for that all you are going to find is comments on the internet. It is extremely common after events like these for people to make up shit trying to justify it as propaganda and for it to get spread widely, it&#39;s nearly like fucking clockwork. Because, again, protecting the reputation and honor of the community is what&#39;s important in this kind of honor based culture, they are less concerned with reality than with appearances.</p>

<p>Yes he did struggle with the person who had a gun pointed at him, but he was approached with a gun drawn. It maybe would have been smart to freeze, in similiarly instances when approached by a robber unarmed it would also probably be smart to freeze. However if I struggle with the robber and get shot, it&#39;s on the robber. People don&#39;t posses a right to walk up to other people in public with a gun drawn. Like at that point it&#39;s pure instinct, your going to fight, freeze, or flee, the decision honestly is probably going to be made at the peripheral nervous system level, the signals never even reach your brain before your arms start doing something. They also weren&#39;t police so they did not really have clear authority at that point, citizens arrest powers do exist but you hardly have all of the immunities of a police officer to use force while attempting one. That&#39;s why it&#39;s <em>usually</em> a bad idea to attempt one, hell since they are so rare and such an obscure legal procedure at this point in time it&#39;s extremely dangerous whether or not they&#39;re innocent simply because nobody is going to realize what&#39;s going on or your authority to do so. </p>

<p>His family also has given testimony that he had gone out jogging that day fyi. This testimony is <em>evidence</em> in court and every bit as valid as any report by bubba on the street that there&#39;d totally been a bunch of burglaries by someone who fits the description of &quot;black male&quot; on the street (would have been helpful if any of these had been reported, if any reports of burglaries on that street had been reported in the previous months then this testimony would maybe have more weight than &quot;Bubbas friend trying to cover for Bubba&quot;, but as it it&#39;s not going to be quite as useful at the trial.</p>

<p>If he <em>had</em> been out burglarizing, why wouldn&#39;t he have brought a car? That would be pretty helpful in these instances. This is not a hood nigga, black people in the countries have cars. You&#39;re really going to go out burglarizing on foot and carry all your stolen goods all the way back home on foot, with no ability to quickly get away should you need to? Country criminals don&#39;t do that. Why burgle an empty house? Why go out burglarizing people unarmed? Why do it at a time when people are home, don&#39;t burglars usually scope out places and burgle them when the occupants are known to be away? February 23, when this happened, a Sunday; nobody goes out burgling midday Sunday. It&#39;s literally the single worst conceivable time. </p>

<p>It is however a good time to go jogging.</p>

<p>Also would have helped a lot if he&#39;d been carrying anything that resembled stolen property. He was not however. &quot;He had a criminal record&quot;, uhmmm sir, he was at one point out exercising his 2nd amendment right to conceal carry without a license, and was the victim of tyrannical state overreach. Really odd honestly that given his prior record of expressing his second amendment rights that he did not choose to do so while apparently burglarizing an empty under construction house, that he didn&#39;t take anything out of, midday Sunday, with no getaway vehicle. Almost like he wasn&#39;t actually intending to do anything at that time that may require the expression of them. He was unfortunately mistaken. This is why all black men at all time should take advantage of your second amendment rights at all times, you never know when you&#39;re going to need them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that Ahmaud was a native of the area and had grown up in it and a nearby county. This should be obvious, he was on foot, in the Georgia country, there&#39;s no way he went very far while on foot. So he was burglarizing his local community apparently.</p>

<p>The officers involved have already testified that they had wanted to do an arrest after investigating the scene of the crime but were blocked by the DA. The DA FYI, was a friend of the two who did the shooting. So those officers were wrong and the corrupt DA was right I guess.</p>

<p>You are asking yourselves, &quot;why&quot;, you&#39;re putting yourself in the shoes of the shooter and can&#39;t understand how they could have shot him if they didn&#39;t have a good reason. I have already told you how this culture works, the goal is to look badass and restore the honor of the community, I am of white southern culture, I understand these people. It&#39;s an honor based culture. In an honor based culture, appearing threatening and badass is what&#39;s important, the facts are not as important, actually killing the guilty isn&#39;t important. It&#39;s a rotten culture wholly obsessed with appearances. That&#39;s why they keep on doing shitty things and throwing tantrums when they get caught and badgering the rest of the nation into looking the other way. </p>

<p><em>Stop</em> giving into these people, only when you stop rewarding this behavior are they going to stop. It&#39;s difficult because their cultural strategies are highly effective, they&#39;ll shame and badger anyone who shares the truth underneath because the truth is the enemy of honor based culture. They feel like you&#39;re attacking your society, because you&#39;ve damaged their precious reputation and appearances, and that precious appearance is the most important thing to them in the world. But these fuckers are going to have to grow up and enter the civilized world some day, the most tragic things is that America has allowed itself to be beaten into submission by these people over and over again, constantly bent over and given up and then reverted to spewing out the the eye-rolling flattery of them and their noble, tough culture required to satiate them at all times. America has rewarded them for their shitty behavior, you keep on rewarding them, and they will never get better. Black people are a victim of the south, but they are a victim of the America which constantly gives up and begins rewarding the south over and over, just as much as they are the south itself. You are <em>not</em> the good guys, you are <em>weak</em>. Ahmaud Arbery is a victim of your <em>cowardice</em>, and I am as well. Fuck you America.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t find any mention of him wearing boots outside of MAGA comments on reddit. Also, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCPEYVJl3Js">hammer</a>. There was a twig on the road and these online right wing morons started claiming that he had a hammer that he threw at the two lynchers. No evidence of that either, the police report doesn&#39;t mention any hammers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like if someone throws a hammer at you and you shoot them dead, the fist thing you mention to the police is the hammer.</p>

<p>If you watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vElX_sLt2NM&amp;amp;bpctr=1589037844">video</a>, he&#39;s wearing shorts and what appear to be sneakers, not Timberland boots. In <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/05/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia-explainer.html">this article</a> running shoes are explicitly mentioned. It&#39;s just right wing racist nuttery, none of it is true.</p>

<p>Hundreds of supporters of the Malheur refuge occupation and the Bundy family converged at the Utah Capitol on Saturday to honor a &quot;fallen hero&quot; and the &quot;patriots&quot; imprisoned in the fight for freedom for which the armed encampment claimed to stand. LaVoy Finicum loved his country and its founding principle of freedom, which he believed is God given, according to Jeanette Finicum, the widow of the Arizona rancher killed by police Jan. 26.</p>
