Even if it&#39;s not the very top-level national government, do you think any governor or mayor is going to risk his city/perfect being turned into another Wuhan with people&#39;s doors being welded shut?

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I know, but if no one can prove otherwise does it matter how many of them are dead? They&#39;re basically indistinguishable from each other anyway.

<p>Bioweapon</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible, but it&#39;s more likely that this may have been part of a gain of function project.</p>

<p>Or just something from the wild that they were working on at the time.</p>

<p>Killing of off the old, fat and disabled, in greater proportions than the young and healthy is what pretty much all infections do. That&#39;s why they&#39;re always telling olds to get their flu shots every year.</p>

<p>This one is a fair bit more virulent, so we&#39;re seeing more of that. But it&#39;s not really something I&#39;d call a weapon specifically.</p>

<p>It is much more likely to be an accident, escaped into the wild; exacerbated by the Chinese government not wanting to look weak, and trying to minimize the situation at first.</p>

<p>Admitting that this was the result of glorious Chinese science making an error, is not something they&#39;ll do easily, or at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Western society</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not just Western society. Places like South Africa and Brazil have been bent over and rawdogged hard. </p>

<p>Like, literally the entire world and the economy of those countries have been fucked over, thanks to China wanting to flex it&#39;s dick and playing with things they probably should be leaving alone for now.</p>
