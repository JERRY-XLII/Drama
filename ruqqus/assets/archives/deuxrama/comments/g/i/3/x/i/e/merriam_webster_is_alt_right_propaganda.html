    <div class="md"><p>In all seriousness, people who are super into LGBT stuff (like, they make it their personality) tend to use &quot;pansexual&quot; instead of &quot;bi-&quot; for this reason. It&#39;s 99% the same. But &quot;bisexual&quot; is mostly used by actually-straight white girls who once drunkenly made out with another girl to get attention from boys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not yet. Was banned from black people twitter for saying this. The fact so many of them support this criminal is scary. Good old ahmaud “armed robbery” arbery </p>

<p>--right before the chase, Ahmuad went into a home under construction and stayed there for 3 mins. He only left when he saw the security cameras.</p>

<p>--a week earlier, there were a series of break ins, which this guy matched.</p>

<p>--right before he was shot, a homeowner saw him peeking through windows of houses.</p>

<p>--he has a criminal record; assault, armed robbery, and suspected to have tried shooting up a high school basketball game because he brought a loaded .38, but was thankfully stopped.</p>

<p>--he was 12 miles from his home, &quot;jogging.&quot;</p>

<p>--he wasn&#39;t wearing jogging gear.</p>

<p>--when the two men jumped out of the truck, they told him to stop and that the police are coming.</p>

<p>--in the video, you can CLEARLY see that he then attacked one of the men, punching him and trying to steal his gun.</p>

<p>--you are allowed to open carry and make citizen arrests in Georgia.</p>

<p>--the police corroborated that he met all the descriptions of the suspect that broke into houses in the EXACT same neighborhood.</p>

<p>--whether you like it or not, this became a clear cut self defense when Ahmaud attacked them. &quot;But MuH fLighT or FiGHt!1!!!11&quot; No. Anyone who didn&#39;t have a motive to escape would have surrendered immediately, but he didn&#39;t because he did not want to get caught by the police.</p>
