    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.</p>

<p>Men don‚Äôt have any good movements or ways to help cultivate an actual healthy sense of masculinity. On top of that, a lot of aspects of society like the school system really punish young boys for being normal and who they are. </p>

<p>All we have are either ‚Äúmale feminists‚Äù who are massively cucked fags. Or ‚Äú‚Äòmen‚Äôs rights‚Äù types who are a bunch of bitter retards with mommy issues.</p>

<p>I can think of several men like my dad, uncle, old sales managers, coworkers etc who have taught me how to be more confident, intelligent, understand my emotions(but not in a faggy way) and just all around better. </p>

<p>I absolutely hate some of the negative images of men and masculinity in media too, such as being unemotional. BecAuse ime it‚Äôs not true. I‚Äôve met tons of dudes willing to talk about emotions and get and give advice from other dudes.</p>

<p>Healthy male relationships are seriously extremely important to guys and it‚Äôs not taken seriously at all. I try my best to be a big brother figure to some of my young friends that don‚Äôt have one and give them advice and shit. </p>

<p>All the best advice I‚Äôve gotten in life has been from them. Mostly my dad who I absolutely admire now. </p>

<p>I used to be a massive loser, but I changed a lot of shit, and I can tell you that all the changes in my thinking that made me a better person were things my dad or uncle or someone had already tried telling me years ago. </p>

<p>So yeah, I‚Äôd love to see more men actually succeeded and learning to be happy and shot, but from all the data, trends and personal experience I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs just not the case. Everything I‚Äôve seen points to women doing better in the future and there‚Äôs no point in burying my head in the sand and coping. It is what it is.</p>

<p>TLDR: dude bussy lmao</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Got damn I never expected to get some insightful and actually meaningful conversation from some reddit meta sub where every other comment is about dudes assholes. </p>

<p>Actually nice though. I‚Äôve had a lot of the same experience. I was a faggot in high school and hated my dad and now I love him more than anything and he‚Äôs taught me so much because he kicked my ass until I actually got my shit together and learned to take responsibility and do what I had to do to get shit done. </p>

<p>I will say it‚Äôs super disappointing that fraternities are being so frowned upon and shit on. Some for very good reason, but I was in a frat and it was great for me in college to just have a shitload of dudes around, and out pledging consisted of opening up to each other with shit I‚Äôd never told anyone before about my life and emotions and shit and it was great. From what I‚Äôve heard at my school shut like that is common too. </p>

<p>Men definitely need more actually good masculine figures like a suburban dad that‚Äôs successful and family oriented, but also has boundaries and discipline, and not faggot guidos on mtv or rapis- sorry, male feminists, teaching them how to be men.</p>

<p>But also to the main point, women are def pushing way ahead of men in success, and fast. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how it plays out in a decade or two and if the rate of change slows or not, and also how society reacts with messaging (ie now it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe future is female‚Äù, see if that changes at all)</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one ignoring scholarships just for having a hole between the legs</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scores on standardized tests aren‚Äôt the only thing that determine success. In fact there much of a determinant than hard work. </p>

<p>Ime women tend to work harder and be more responsible.</p>

<p>They also have higher emotional intelligence which more and more research is finding is very important to success. </p>

<p>also, scholarships don‚Äôt just blindly turn dumb bitches into doctors. The women that get them still work hard and are intelligent and shit. They still have to compete against other roasts. </p>

<p>Anyways I‚Äôm also saying that women will also continue to do better because there‚Äôs going to be more and more scholarships for them. </p>

<p>They actually support eachother, unlike men, so obviously their success will continue to grow</p>

<p>Lmao, look at who works in the most dangerous fields and all the single mothers</p>

<blockquote>
<p>emotional intelligence</p>

<p>Look at the amount of CEOs that are men. And you think they can&#39;t change the questions to ones that might suit women more or that the answers can be completely objective?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Blacks are more likely to get into medical college than a white or asian person with the same or higher GPA, you think there isn&#39;t a similar system for women?</p>

<p>Sure men might be better in oil fields and shit, but I‚Äôm talking about at like college. Young women take shit more seriously than men. </p>

<p>Why would male CEOs try to change answers for
Women?</p>

<p>I do think there‚Äôs a similar system for women, but it‚Äôs not going away soon so women will continue to do better is what I‚Äôm saying</p>

<p>Because they&#39;re artificially propped up.</p>
