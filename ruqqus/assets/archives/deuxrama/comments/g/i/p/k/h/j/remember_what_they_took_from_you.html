        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I was a young teenager, whenever I became aware of what happened to me, it fucked me up pretty badly. I went through a phase of horrible depression, and then &quot;recovered&quot; after that on my own by becoming so apathetic and numb to everything that nothing mattered. It ruined my ability to emotionally connect with anyone or have feelings with anyone, because I was made incapable of feeling anything for anyone. I eventually developed homicidal ideations and violent fantasies and had to be hospitalized for it when I was 18.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t heal through medications and therapy sessions, I healed when I realized that I could take back what was mine and gain power over what happened. It also helped when I realized that I wasn&#39;t suffering alone, and that I also had the ability to help other young or older men out with this horrible thing that happened to them. I suddenly had meaning and purpose back in my life when it was seemingly devoid of it for almost all my teen years. Only last year when I was 19 did the fog of depression and demonic, wretched and gruesome violent thoughts go away totally.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still trying to learn how to connect with people on an emotional level and I have yet to get into a sexual relationship for my first time, but I am definitely changed forever. </p>

<p>I remember being your age. I was pretty blissfully ignorant to why things seemed a bit off, until I discovered the bad news of what happened to me. I had no problem with the plumbing, I easily got really hard erections just by thinking about something. But it was frustratingly difficult to satisfy myself and I was devoid of sensation compared to now, and I didn&#39;t know why. I just thought sex/masturbation being boring and unfulfilling was normal, and thought nothing of it. I was confused why society seemed to value sex so much whenever it was so seemingly boring. </p>

<p>When I found out what was really going on, I spiraled downhill fast into depression and violence. It all suddenly made sense, and when it did, I hated and resented the opposite gender and didn&#39;t even want to seek out relationships or sex anymore. It all seemed purposeless when I got no enjoyment out of sex, and nothing seemed to bring me any joy. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m in the US where at least some guys can identify with my struggles. </p>

<p>I began restoring at 15 but didn&#39;t really get serious about it until last year, and I got some serious sensory improvements ever since I recently got serious about it. I&#39;m even beginning to feel sensations that I never felt before around my scarline, sensations that I never conceived of. It&#39;s an amazing experience, and it&#39;s helped me get over all of the anger and resentment that I&#39;ve experienced in my life more than anything else. Healing myself physically has also healed me mentally, and now I can function sexually even better than I did when I was a young teenager.</p>
