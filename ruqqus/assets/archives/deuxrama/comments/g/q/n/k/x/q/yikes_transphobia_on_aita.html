<p>Really? Do you know who that is? Do you spend any time on the chans, or 8kun, or Gab, or Voat, or Discord/ Telegram/ Riot, or a wide variety of lessor known neo-Nazi hangouts?</p>

<p>I do.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This is the scariest, most disgusting thing I’ve ever been through. I’m a student at a popular, liberal university, living in a house off campus with 5 housemates. I’ve lived here two semesters already and plan on staying until August when I get my own place. A few months ago we took on a new roommate, let’s call her Jessica. Jessica is a trans woman which is fine with everyone there. We all get along and occasionally hang out.
Jessica did seem a bit weird sometimes, but we figured she was nice enough and wasn’t hurting anyone so it was all okay.
Long story short, I recently let her borrow my hairdryer and she forgot to give it back to me after she left for class. I usually wouldn’t do this, but I was in a hurry and my hair was wet so I decided to go into her room to get my dryer.
What I saw was so disturbing. The smell in the room was terrible, like a public bathroom. There were bottles of urine everywhere. But worst of all... there was a ziplock bag with used tampons under her desk. On top of her desk was a plastic cup with one of the used tampons, and water.
I ran out and threw up. I didn’t know what to think. I woke up one of my other housemates and told her what was going on. She looked with me and was shocked. We took pictures to show our other roommates.
Once everyone knew and Jessica came back we had a house meeting. The 5 of us told her we knew what she was doing and asked her why. She screamed that we shouldn’t have went into her room and that we’re being transphobic. We told her we want her out by the end of the month. She cried and told us that she can’t afford estrogen and doesn’t have insurance, so people online told her that using period blood was a way to “become a woman”.
I feel really bad for her, but I can’t do this... none of us can. Are we wrong for telling her she has to go?
TL;DR: My housemates and I just discovered that our trans housemate has been making “tea” out of our used tampons because s/he can’t afford hormonal pills. We don’t feel safe and want this person gone.
AITA?</p>
