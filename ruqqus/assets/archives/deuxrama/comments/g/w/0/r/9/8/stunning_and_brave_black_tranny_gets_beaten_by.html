        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The main video and the narrative: tranny gets beaten for a small car accident. A pack of black men crowd someone weaker and beat the shit out of them (as they&#39;re wont to do). Does the usual, sets up crowdfunding to finance her degeneracy.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FATHERBONNET/status/1267989851460317185?s=20">https://twitter.com/FATHERBONNET/status/1267989851460317185?s=20</a></p>

<p>Now it gets spicier when other black people put some context to that story. Turns out the tranny was under the influence, stole a car for a joyride (allegedly with the children of the owner inside the car), and crashes it into several car in a parking lot after some pretty reckless driving (say what you will that tranny drives like a real woman).</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/xumiee1/status/1267995296262471681">https://twitter.com/xumiee1/status/1267995296262471681</a></p>

<p>But it&#39;s not all! Another video (17 minutes) surfaces, showing that cis black women (the kind that still look like dudes but don&#39;t have dicks) started the fight. Both started hitting the tranny, and yelling &quot;transphobic slurs&quot; (which in your day and age can mean anything short of sucking the tranny&#39;s dick). If anyone has that video (supposedly 17m long) plz post it.</p>

<p>So the story get posted on <a href="/r/blackladies">/r/blackladies</a> with a title explaining the involvement of the sheboons in that hate crime. Which leads (as most things on that subs) to many complaints from users. In unusual fashion the mods then put their foot down and admit black women might do wrong on rare occasions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/gvjz2w/iyanna_dior_is_a_black_trans_woman_beaten_by_a/fsrm5ez/">https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/gvjz2w/iyanna_dior_is_a_black_trans_woman_beaten_by_a/fsrm5ez/</a></p>

<p>Rest of the comments are mostly the sheboons angry that the title mentions their kind was guilty, and stating that black women dindu nuffin.</p>

<p>Others will explain why the tranny had it coming :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/gvjz2w/iyanna_dior_is_a_black_trans_woman_beaten_by_a/fsrj0sk/">https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/gvjz2w/iyanna_dior_is_a_black_trans_woman_beaten_by_a/fsrj0sk/</a></p>

<p>And cherry on top : the TERF/blackladies crossover episode. Wherein the tranny didn&#39;t ask for it, but kind of because trannies are invading female spaces.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/gvjz2w/iyanna_dior_is_a_black_trans_woman_beaten_by_a/fspq08x/">https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/gvjz2w/iyanna_dior_is_a_black_trans_woman_beaten_by_a/fspq08x/</a></p>

<p>EDIT : couldn&#39;t resist adding the <a href="/r/MtF">/r/MtF</a> reaction to it (turns out they&#39;re ACAB until they realize those brave black people killed by the police would love nothing more than to beat a few trannies), here&#39;s my favorite comment there :</p>

<p>More like violent hatred. And I love how the lgbtqzp+ have to watch every word when describing those incidents.</p>

<p>In France a tranny was beaten and robbed during a parade of algerian citizens. Which was funny because the dude tried to avoid any mention of the attackers ethnicity. And when journalists discussed the subject, the tranny spent most of its time pointing out that it&#39;s a problem for all men, not just young muslims (despite most violent homophobic and transphobic attacks coming from those groups).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just downvoted your post.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>What does this mean?</h2>

<p>The amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has decreased by one.</p>

<h2>Why did you do this?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rudeness towards other Redditors,</li>
<li>Spreading incorrect information,</li>
<li>Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a <code>/s</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Am I banned from the Reddit?</h2>

<p>No - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.</p>

<h2>I don&#39;t believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?</h2>

<p>Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</p>

<h2>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</h2>

<p>Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. This story is jumping in the rabbit hole, you always find new threads and each groups involved has a different angle. I hope it blows up and there&#39;s even more detail to surface because given the groups involved there&#39;s no way it doesn&#39;t turn to chaos!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transphobia affects cis women. Imagine a (cis)girl who is taller than usual and maybe has &#39;masculine&#39; facial features and then everyone decides to call her a &#39;man&#39; because of this. Maybe it then turns into bullying and harassment. Maybe this girl develops very low self esteem, some forms of self hatred etc.  </p>

<p>If people accept that women can look like anything and anyone, that girl will be left alone to thrive in her intended way. If people didn&#39;t automatically think &#39;masculine features&#39; = man or that to be treated like a &#39;woman&#39; you have to look a certain way or have certain parts then it would make life better for cis- AND trans people.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve simplified a lot but people need to realise that trans matters do not only affect trans people. It affects EVERYONE.</p>

<p>Support tranny rights please so ugly foids don&#39;t get bullied anymore.</p>
