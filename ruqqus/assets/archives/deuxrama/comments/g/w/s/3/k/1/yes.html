<p>If you unironically say &quot;most people are dumb&quot; then you&#39;re an arrogant, pompous, faggot. </p>

<p>It&#39;s by definition impossible for most people to be dumb because if someone is &quot;dumb&quot; that means that they are less intelligent than average. </p>

<p>You think you&#39;re smart and you&#39;re comparing the average person to you, but you probably aren&#39;t smart considering you said something as dumb as that.</p>

Now imagine a point of time where the average person is a 200 IQ Saul Kripke tier genius.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s basically unheard of. One way it&#39;s been looked at is this: take a retarded/genius sibling and see whether their sibling is midway (or so) between the population mean and the extreme sibling. For cases where, say, a child is idiopathically retarded, their sibling is at the mean, whereas in normal cases, the sibling is only part of the way there. Idiopathic retardation is much more common for lots of reasons, including, importantly, injury to the brain. You can drop a brick on someone&#39;s head to make them retarded, but there are no cases of the reverse happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How the fuck is that circular reasoning? Do you have any idea how culture actually works? It changes over time.</p>

<p>To answer your question it&#39;s hard to say when American black culture really doubled down on the idea that contributing to society and being happy is for white people, but I would say it&#39;s likely either a product of gang culture or came some time earlier in US history. Blacks born literally anywhere besides the US immigrate here and succeed all the time so I think the problem is specifically American</p>

Haiti: GDP per capita= $770

Same island. Same disasters. Essentially the same resources. Haiti got their independence earlier. The most stark, major difference is Haiti is almost entirely black while the Dominicans are Hispanic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a completely unironic post.  </p>

<p>Jews are good at verbal‐oriented tasks (soft science) and actual shit at anything else. Any field that requires debate to determine the &quot;best answer&quot; they flock to in droves (social sciences and particularly law come to mind). Anybody that has regularly debated with jews knows the futility of such a thing. They don&#39;t do actual scientist work because they see physical labor of any kind as beneath them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Von Neumann was unironically the smartest human being to ever live. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall. As far as I could tell, von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim; moreover, he could do it years later without hesitation. He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English. On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how A Tale of Two Cities started. Whereupon, without any pause, he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or how about </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two bicyclists start twenty miles apart and head toward each other, each going at a steady rate of 10 m.p.h. At the same time, a fly that travels at a steady 15 m.p.h. starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover?</p>

<p>There are two ways to answer the problem. One is to calculate the distance the fly covers on each leg of its trips between the two bicycles and finally sum the infinite series so obtained. The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly an hour after they start so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles. When the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: “Oh, you must have heard the trick before!” “What trick,” asked von Neumann, “all I did was sum the infinite series.”</p>

<p>Very little happens in tens of thousands of years, evolution is extremely slow.</p>

<p>The reason humans cant be divided into races is because while there are obviously some differences they are minor conpared to the variations that exist within the group. While a Swede is obviously different from a Nigerian in some ways the Swede is also likely to be substantially different from another Swede.</p>

<p>This is especially true in Africa which has the by far most diverse DNA of any continent.</p>
