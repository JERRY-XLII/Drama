    <div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>Psychologists use the term ‚Äúsocialization‚Äù to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.</p></li>
<li><p>The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term ‚Äúoversocialized‚Äù to describe such people.</p></li>
<li><p>Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society‚Äôs expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society‚Äôs expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They lie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person cannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The oversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality; he cannot think ‚Äúunclean‚Äù thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality; we are socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another.</p></li>
<li><p>We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university intellectuals [3] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing segment.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been with a few women in my life and one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the female anus is incredibly close to the vagina, in fact they&#39;re barely an inch apart.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about other guys - but doesn&#39;t this disturb you? It feels like a design flaw in women actually -- like they&#39;re supposed to be so feminine and beautiful yet this ghastly little oversight is ruining everything.</p>

<p>Somehow it feels to me that women should be more aware of this flaw and it should affect their confidence. Whenever I see a so-called beautiful woman walking down the street so care-free thinking she&#39;s all that I just remember her anus is only 1 inch away from her pussy and laugh her into oblivion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is this but also takes advantage of people&#39;s pride and desire to flex. that&#39;s why liberals code switch and talk down to black people. By shitting on their own race and elevating others they&#39;re basically showing how confident in their perceived status and wealth they are. this started from elites but has become cargo culted by reddit tier plebs as well</p>
