    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m a fat lazy fuck who loves hamburger and pizza. But it feels like billionnaires who rape underage ukrainian supermodels on private jets would do their raping somewhere else than in the small backroom of a shitty pizzeria. There&#39;s so many businesses where you have very big warehouses linked to small storefronts. This way you could totally hide those activities in total comfort.</p>

<p>Even better in businesses where huge buildings are shared by several activities (you could have hidden passages between offices, warehouses...).</p>

<p>You could have a huge hidden soundproof bordello with all the luxury you want, and have it accessible through several staircases hidden in different offices through the same building. Make some of those office legal, PR, or accounting firms, and you&#39;d have a legit excuse for your clients to come and go. Even some immunity from legal scrutiny.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m overthinking it, and I would be better off offering consulting services to rich pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s more of a working class pedo ring? That still has nothing better to do than operate from a pizza place? Even poor pedos can afford windowless vans, and houses with large basements. One of them even kept captives for years, in a basement he built himself, with an entrance hidden behind shelves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that. But even local politicians can do better than the back of a pizzeria. The back of it is relatively small (that&#39;s the point of such an establishment, small kitchen since all their menu items revolve around the same basics and they have ovens that can do a lot at a time). It&#39;s similar to other fast food (McDonalds, Subway).</p>

<p>Now all things being equal (real estate prices, concealability) there&#39;s a lot more businesses that could be a better front for such an operation, and allow more room to fuck underage sex slaves.</p>

<p>Even something like a locksmith, or a cobbler, tailor... They have a small front offices, but bigger workshops in the back.</p>

<p>Also in bigger, affluent cities, rented offices (or workspace sharing companies) can have several private rooms.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a politician : say you rented a room for a team meeting, and the contents are sensitive. That explains why the rooms are soundproof, why the building has lots of foot traffic (lots of different politicians going in and out), and it also prevents randos from walking in (rent the office space from a different office that operates over the phone, and either always be &quot;full&quot; or rent from different, normal, space to normal clients).</p>

<p>Gives you lot of room for your raping, and it can be fully furnished, also not attract attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone remember when the FBI released a document from its vault that contained an archeological sketch of a tunnel underneath a school in connection with an alleged child trafficking/porn network that they were investigating in 1982?</p>

<p>Anyone else remember in 1984, when the investigation into the McMartin preschool revealed that children were allegedly lying about those exact tunnels?</p>

<p>Did anyone else read that FBI document and wonder why the FBI AND the CIA were extremely concerned about a traffic stop in Tallahassee, FL?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my country there was a litteraly a rumor that jews were using a submarine in secret underground waterways (in a city that was as far from the coast as possible) to abduct women from dressing rooms in clothing stores, and sell them into prostitution networks. It was like in the 70s. The whole country was &quot;on the case&quot;. Then it died out (from retardation). And people still float similar rumors in different cities nowadays (although they sometimes replace the jews with gypos, who don&#39;t have a submarine in that version because apparently nobody would believe that they&#39;d be smart enough to operate it).</p>
