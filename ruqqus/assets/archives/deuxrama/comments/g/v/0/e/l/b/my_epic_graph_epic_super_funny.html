    <div class="md"><p>Minecraft is the reason Gen Z is becoming so redpilled. Here&#39;s some fun things to think about:</p>

<p>Steve: A white male ubermensch who conquers nature and carves it into his own dominion. He builds beautiful structures and ingenious redstone technology.</p>

<p>Zombies: Represent the bugman. Slow, stupid, and outnumber Steve by 100 to 1. They have no ulterior motives beyond consumption.</p>

<p>Creepers: Represent muslims. Not only do they blow themselves up but they are also green which is a color strongly associated with Islam.</p>

<p>Enderman: A tall black man who steals shit and can&#39;t swim</p>

<p>Villagers: Big nosed merchants who live in the desert and have their hands constantly rubbed together</p>

<p>Notch saw that Sweden was getting cucked and made Minecraft in collaboration with Pewdiepie in an effort to redpill the Aryan youth</p>

<p>Untill I&#39;m in power. That&#39;s why I weaken it now.</p>

<p>Imagine unironically being so beta that you become a lolbertarian instead of seeing freedom as a mere vehicle to take power and enforce your worldview for all to obey. You&#39;re literally admitting that you&#39;ll cope with people not being exactly as you imagine them. You&#39;re being indecisive and refusing to make the world based no matter what. What a beta male worldview. That&#39;s why I see the libertarian-authoritarian slider on the political compass as a &quot;how much do you want it?&quot; slider.</p>

Every time I&#39;m told &quot;you&#39;re privileged because you&#39;re white, straight, able, Christian, and upper middle class, you are literally in the most powerful societal group&quot; I wish it&#39;d work that way because that means I&#39;d be the boot. That&#39;s why everyone who claims &quot;you won&#39;t be the boot after your coup!!!1!!&quot; is a fucking idiot because they spend all their time saying we&#39;re the ones profiting from right wing authoritarianism, a direct contradiction. I know that I must further the goals of my group first and for that to be done most efficiently the boots must be mine. We must extremify the society that the left claims is benefiting us, because obviously it&#39;s not enough. Time to buy some riot gear on ebay and get inside the armoured truck with my fellow DeuxChads to roll into the high-crime ghettos. It&#39;s AuthRight takeover time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why all lefties aren&#39;t tankies because if I was them I&#39;d want what&#39;s best for my group over all else, so I&#39;d AuthMaxx the fuck out of a welfare society. I think it&#39;s because they&#39;re hella pathetic and can&#39;t organise a proper revolution. Oh also because it won&#39;t actually benefit them because communism doesn&#39;t work. Leftoids btfo.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, your entire comment is seething on all fronts and everyone can tell. This would be good if you didn&#39;t attempt to hide it like a leftoid beta would do. &quot;Feel your anger. Embrace your hate. Let it elevate your mental state.&quot; are words you should know of.</p>

<p>If you think I am seething you are gravely mistaken. I&#39;m in the preparation phase. If I was mad I&#39;d be doing nothing except wallowing in self pity. What I&#39;m doing is announcing my ability and intent to take down the bad mayos that are helping the non-mayos so good mayos like me and my fellow DeuxChads can install absolute mayo leadership. We won&#39;t be supporting mayo foids though since they are literally disgusting. Rather volcel or polluting the gene pools of non-mayos than mayo gussy. </p>
