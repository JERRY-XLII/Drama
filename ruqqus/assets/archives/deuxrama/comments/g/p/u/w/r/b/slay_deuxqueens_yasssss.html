<ol>
<li>you&#39;re sharing protein</li>
<li>you&#39;re admiring masculine physique</li>
<li>being in the vacinity of other high testosterone males increases your own testosterone</li>
<li>eating pussy is gay because you&#39;re litterally slurping down estrogen. and long term relationships have been proven to lower testosterone.</li>

<p>spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity. you bet they were at least fondling eachothers test producers.</p>

<p>all these summer DYEL&#39;s piss me off. their twink bodies don&#39;t understand, but in time i&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I browsed the news. A story about niggers, written by a nigger, talked about how niggers needed more et. cetera. The needs of a nigger are endless. A nigger on every television channel. A nigger in every movie. Nothing but nigger music for niggers and those who wish to be niggers. That is almost worse than being a nigger. At least a nigger does not want to be a nigger. A nigger does not want to be a nigger so badly that he will kill everyone who is not a nigger just so that he might not be reminded that he is a nigger. I was glad to be alone in my room again, where no nigger had ever been. There are few places left like this in the world. When the nigger was freed the world became the nigger&#39;s slave.</p>

<p>At night the niggers come out, brave in the absence of light, as if the night were an accomplice to the niggers, lending shadow to the misdeeds of the niggers. Beneath the luminescence of gaudy streetlights, the gangs of niggers, in feral nigger packs, would stumble and howl, liquored up on cheap nigger drinks and enthused by scantily clad negresses. In the day these niggers were more docile. The tumult of the niggers grew tedious and I decided to leave, to walk perhaps to a place where no niggers ever went. To do this I needed to walk down the niggerstained streets and wait in a subway overrun by niggers. Every nigger looked at me as if waiting for me to call them what they, as niggers, knew what I, as not a nigger, knew them to be. Most of the passengers were niggers or niglets. Each nigger stared at the other nigger with the suspicion that infects every nigger due to the violence inherent in each nigger. No one knows what a nigger is capable of more than a nigger. That is why niggers leer as they do, for niggers assume that everyone has a propensity for violence equal to a nigger&#39;s.</p>

<p>In the fresh blossoming night air after I had risen from the stench of a niggersoiled subway, I felt a peace that can only be known when all niggers are absent. Perhaps this is the reason why niggers are so disgruntled: they never have a chance to leave niggers behind. Perhaps these types of free and fresh nights are not available to niggers who must leer with niggerhate in their niggerheads and niggerhearts all the days of their niggardly lives. But now the streets were clean, vacant of all niggers and the cacophony of niggers. I had come out of that nigger-Gehenna where the golems of the niggerloving kikes waste and writhe. I was lost in the coolness of a midnight devoid of niggers.</p>

<p>It was almost ruined, knowing I would have to return to the niggers. Knowing that everywhere else, niggers were muddying everything with their niggerhands and their niggernotions. But for now there was a peace of no niggers.</p>
