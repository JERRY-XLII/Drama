Apparently being open/accepting about your homosexuality is very frowned on by Catholics. Probably a tradition started by jealous priests in order to keep out the competition. On the post there&#39;s some quibbling on differences between &quot;being gay&quot; and having occasional bouts of &quot;same sex attraction&quot; and then suddenly AHS links to the post and shits all over the thread. </p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/gbonvv/i_am_15_years_old_and_i_am_dealing_with_ssa/">https://old.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/gbonvv/i_am_15_years_old_and_i_am_dealing_with_ssa/</a></p>

<p>The internet volunteer janitors had to clean it all up on a weekend. 😢</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gc4d0y/15_year_old_asks_for_advice_about_homosexuality/">https://old.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gc4d0y/15_year_old_asks_for_advice_about_homosexuality/</a></p>

<p>Apparently AHS has run out of MDE ban evasion subs to pearl-clutch about so they&#39;ve moved on to complaining that Catholics and Indians ( <a href="/r/Chodi">/r/Chodi</a> ) are allowed to post on Reddit. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gc4tgs/a_child_having_samesex_parents_is_cruel_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/gc4tgs/a_child_having_samesex_parents_is_cruel_and/</a></p>

<p>Now this is when the gay OP starts getting addicted to the drama. He posts on <a href="/r/Catholicism">/r/Catholicism</a> AGAIN making a meta post about AHS&#39; brigade on his original post</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/gcjzul/i_made_a_post_about_my_sexuality_and_it_kinda/">https://old.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/gcjzul/i_made_a_post_about_my_sexuality_and_it_kinda/</a></p>

<p>The completely voluntary Catholic e-janitor force made sure to keep the comments section clean after brigaders appeared:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.removeddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/gcjzul/i_made_a_post_about_my_sexuality_and_it_kinda/">https://www.removeddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/gcjzul/i_made_a_post_about_my_sexuality_and_it_kinda/</a></p>

<p>And then not even two hours later the OP went on to make YET ANOTHER meta post in the completely unrelated AgainstDegenerateSubs in order to get his drama-dopamine fix:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstDegenerateSubs/comments/gcll1g/ragainsthatesubs_made_a_post_about_rcatholicism/">https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstDegenerateSubs/comments/gcll1g/ragainsthatesubs_made_a_post_about_rcatholicism/</a></p>

<p>Someone needs to introduce this dude to <a href="/r/askgaybros">/r/askgaybros</a> which is unironically one of the very few good subreddits on this site. Those f@ggots post more useful comments and waaay more dramatic happenings than <a href="/r/drama">/r/drama</a> ever does 🤭</p>

<p>I originally posted this on rdrama but of course their stupid automod got me for saying something or other and that ruined Snappy&#39;s chance to archive this for future generations. Why do I even bother with rdrama at this point 😒</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol as a gay with an extremely complicated past and complicated present I can assure you that is not what that means. You took Jesus words completely out of context </p>

<p>(19:3-9)</p>

<p>Pharisees came to him and brought up the subject of divorce.</p>

<p>Jesus said divorce is only agreeable if one of the spouses cheat.</p>

<p>The disciples say to him </p>

<p>&quot;His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.&quot; (19:10)</p>

<p>He responds with the verses you listed,</p>

<p>Jesus was speaking about both Literal eunuchs, (those who were born with birth defects or who were made that way by accident or mutilation.)</p>

<p>And those who freely made themselves figurative eunuchs. </p>

<p>Though eligible for marriage, 
 they chose to stay single so that they could devote themselves to God.</p>

<p>They were neither born with with the circumstances to be permanently single nor granted it. They actually chose to live like eunuchs (aka not marry).</p>

<p>It had nothing to do with the sexuality of the &quot;eunuch&quot;  you dolt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair point, he <em>was</em> talking about divorce. At least my Bible says so before the passage. I have a tendency to apply knowledge from one particular situation to another in which it may not be 100% applicable. </p>

<p>I do believe that living as a eunuch is all a homosexual can hope to do. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious what your argument is, then. Is being gay immoral, even if you live as the eunuch? What does the Bible tell you about homosexuality?</p>
