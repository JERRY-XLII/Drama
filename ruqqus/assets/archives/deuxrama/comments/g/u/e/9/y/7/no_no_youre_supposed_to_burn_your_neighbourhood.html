    <div class="md"><p>So yeah, you&#39;re a socialist... </p>

<p>Look, I&#39;ll try explain some of this stuff simply without asking you to ReAd a Book like the typical retardit halfwit. </p>

<p>The term &quot;capitalism&quot; as employed as a slur in the Marxist tradition (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/jewish-question/">actually referring to Judaism originally</a>) just means greed. To quote Marx, an attitude devoted to &quot;huckstering, egoism, self-interest and money&quot;. </p>

<p>A Capitalist as per Adam Smith is just a term which refers to any sort of investor. One who employs capital toward his ends. </p>

<p>Capitalism as defended in the libertarian tradition refers to an emergent order algorithm. Price + competition = efficiency (lower costs, higher quality). Evolution works the same way. Every enduring biological system functions as a set of nested emergent order algorithms. </p>

<p>As soon as someone decides to retard the algorithm with political distribution (socialism) the algorithm can&#39;t function and the result is higher cost and lower quality leading to poverty and ultimately societal destabilisation and collapse. </p>

<p>This is why socialism always, every single fucking time, necessarily fails. Political distribution is the deliberate retardation of economic distribution, indistriminate from willful corruption.</p>

<p>This is also why liberalisation (in the old sense of the word before it was corrupted by postmodern idiots) always leads to economy, which always leads to massive improvements in the wealth of all participant. </p>

<p>There are many great national examples, but perhaps none so effective as the relationship between Venezuela and Chile. Once upon a time, Chile was the poorest most socialist country in South America while Venezuela was the most liberal and the wealthiest. Chile decided to learn from this, and liberalise, while Venezuela adopted communism. Chile is now the wealthiest nation in South America, while Venezuela is the poorest.</p>

<p>Political distribution leads to poverty. </p>

<p>So, renounce socialist degeneracy and just embrace the new crypto financial system as a peaceful form of protest. If we remove control over the money supply from politicians and bankers, we can all watch as significant swathes of devastating corruption evaporates into arrests and a smorgasbord of televised criminal trials leading to justice for the political elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are using the same arguments as a antimarxist, you seem like a smart guy, do you really think that capitalism as described by Adam Smith is reality when there are monopolies and grotesque worker rights violations, i am really sick right now but ill try to have an unfruitful debate with a stranger although i dont think i will ever change a mind who holds libertarianism as human nature, forgive spelling mistakes because as i said i am not in the best of health right now due to corona, repeatedly dismissed as an obsolete &quot;doctrine,&quot; Marxism retains a compelling contemporary quality, for it is less a body of fixed dicta and more a method of looking beyond immediate appearances to see the inner qualities and moving forces that shape social relations and much of history itself. As Marx noted: &quot;All science would be super fluous if outward appearances and the essence of things directly coincided.&quot; Indeed, perhaps the reason so much of modern social science seems superfluous is because it settles for the tedious tracing of outward appearances.</p>

<p><em>To understand capitalism, one first has to strip away the appear ances presented by its ideology. Unlike most bourgeois theorists, Marx realized that what capitalism claims to be and what it actually is are two different things. What is unique about capitalism is the systematic expropriation of labor for the sole purpose of accumula tion. Capital annexes living labor in order to accumulate more capi tal. The ultimate purpose of work is not to perform services for consumers or sustain life and society, but to make more and more money for the investor irrespective of the human and environmental costs.</em></p>

<p>An essential point of Marxist analysis is that the social structure and class order prefigure our behavior in many ways. Capitalism moves into every area of work and community, harnessing all of social life to its pursuit of profit. It converts nature, labor, science, art, music, and medicine into commodities and commodities into capital. It transforms land into real estate, folk culture into mass cul ture, and citizens into debt-ridden workers and consumers.</p>

<p>Marxists understand that a class society is not just a divided society ety but one ruled by class power, with the state playing the crucial role in maintaining the existing class structure. Marxism might be considered a &quot;holistic&quot; science in that it recognizes the links between various components of the social system. Capitalism is not just an economic system but a political and cultural one as well, an entire social order. When we study any part of that order, be it the news or entertainment media, criminal justice, Congress, defense spending, overseas military intervention, intelligence agencies, campaign finance, science and technology, education, medical care, taxation, transportation, housing, or whatever, we will see how the particular part reflects the nature of the whole. Its unique dynamic often buttresses and is shaped by the larger social system -espe- cially the system&#39;s overriding need to maintain the prerogatives of the corporate class.</p>

<p>In keeping with their system-sustaining function, the major news media present reality as a scatter of events and subjects that ostensi bly bear little relation to each other or to a larger set of social rela tions. Consider a specific phenomenon like racism. Racism is presented as essentially a set of bad attitudes held by racists. There is little analysis of what makes it so functional for a class society</p>

<p>Instead, race and class are treated as mutually exclusive concepts in competition with each other. But those who have an understanding of class power know that as class contradictions deepen and come to the fore, racism becomes not less but more important as a factor in class conflict. In short, both race and class are likely to be crucial are nas of struggle at the very same time.</p>

<p>Marxists further maintain that racism involves not just personal attitude but institutional structure and systemic power. They point out that racist organizations and sentiments are often propagated by well-financed reactionary forces seeking to divide the working pop ulace against itself, fracturing it into antagonistic ethnic enclaves.</p>

<p>Marxists also point out that racism is used as a means of depression ing wages by keeping a segment of the labor force vulnerable to super-exploitation. To see racism in the larger context of corporate society is to move from a liberal complaint to a radical analysis.</p>

<p>Instead of thinking that racism is an irrational output of a basically rational and benign system, we should see it is a rational output of a basically irrational and unjust system. By &quot;rational&quot; I mean purpose sive and functional in sustaining the system that nurtures it.</p>

<p>Lacking a holistic approach to society, conventional social science tends to compartmentalize social experience. So we are asked to ponder whether this or that phenomenon is cultural or economic or psychological, when usually it is a blend of all these things. Thus, an automobile is unmistakably an economic artifact but it also has a cultural and psychological component, and even an aesthetic dimen sion. We need a greater sense of how analytically distinct phenomena are often empirically interrelated and may actually gather strength and definition from each other.</p>

<p>Marxists do not accept the prevalent view of institutions as just &quot;being there,&quot; with all the natural innocence of mountains-espe cially the more articulated formal institutions such the church, army, police, military, university, media, medicine, and the like.</p>

<p>Institutions are heavily shaped by class interests and class power. Far from being neutral and independent bastions, the major institutions of society are tied to the big business class. Corporate representatives exercise direct decision-making power through control of governing boards and directorships. Business elites usually control the budgets and the very property of various institutions, a control inscribed into law through corporate charters and enforced by the police powers of the state. Their power extends to the managers picked, the policies set, and the performances of employees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If conventional social science has any one dedication, it is to ignore the linkages between social action and the systemic demands of capi talism, avoiding any view of power in its class dimensions, and any view of class as a power relationship. For conventional researchers, power is seen as fragmented and fluid, and class is nothing more than an occupational or income category to be correlated with voting habits, consumer styles or whatever, and not as a relationship between those who own and those who labor for those who own.</p>

<p>In the Marxist view there can be no such thing as a class as such, a social entity unto itself. There can be no lords without serfs, no masters without slaves, no capitalists without workers. More than just a sociological category, class is a relationship to the means of production and to social and state power. This idea, so fundamental to an understanding of public policy, is avoided by conventional social scientists who prefer to concentrate on everything else but class power realities.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, for instance, that some political scientists have studied the presidency and Congress for decades without uttering a word about capitalism, without so much as a sidelong glance at how the imperatives of a capitalist politico-economic order play such a crucial role in prefiguring the political agenda. Social science is clut tered with community power studies&quot; that treat communities and issues as isolated autonomous entities. Such investigations are usu ally limited to the immediate interplay of policy actors, with little said about how issues link up to a larger range of social interests.</p>

<p><em>Conservative ideological preconceptions regularly influence the research strategies of most social scientists and policy analysts. In political science, for instance:</em></p>

<p><em>(1) The relationships between industrial capitalist nations and Third World nations are described as (a) &quot;dependency&quot; and &quot;inter dependency&quot; and as fostering a mutually beneficial development, rather than (b) an imperialism that exploits the land, labor, and resources of weaker nations for the benefit of the favored classes in both the industrial and less-developed worlds.</em></p>

<p><em>(2) The United States and other &quot;democratic capitalist&quot; societies are said to be held together by (a) common values that reflect the com mon interest, not by (b) class power and domination.</em></p>

<p><em>(3) The fragmentation of power in the political process is supposed edly indicative of (a) a fluidity and democratization of interest group pluralism, rather than (b) the pocketing and structuring of power in unaccountable and undemocratic ways.</em></p>

<p><em>(4) The mass propagation of conventional political beliefs is described as (a) political &quot;socialization&quot; and &quot;education for citizen ship,&quot; and is treated as a desirable civic process, rather than (b) an indoctrination that distorts the information flow and warps the pub lie&#39;s critical perceptions.</em></p>

<p><em>In each of these instances, mainstream academics offer version a not as a research finding but as an a priori assumption that requires no critical analysis, upon which research is then predicated. At the same time they disregard the evidence and research that supports version b.</em></p>

<p><em>By ignoring the dominant class conditions that exercise such an influence over social behavior, conventional social science can settle on surface factualness, trying to explain immediate actions in exclu sively immediate terms. Such an approach places a high priority on epiphenomenal and idiosyncratic explanations, the peculiarities of specific personalities and situations. What is habitually overlooked in such research (and in our news reports, our daily observations, and sometimes even our political struggles) is the way seemingly remote forces may prefigure our experiences.</em></p>
