    <div class="md"><p>Read news stories on it. That’ll tell you the series of events and the alleged crime. However, they fail to report that the man who was shot was reportedly seen burgling homes in the area. There are some reports that he was 13 km from his home, and was wearing clothing not appropriate for jogging, and that he was armed with a hammer, leading many to believe that he was out to rob houses. That’ll be in the news although they won’t report on the nuances of why people think he’s a robber. Hope that helps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>--right before the chase, Ahmuad went into a home under construction and stayed there for 3 mins. He only left when he saw the security cameras.</p>

<p>--a week earlier, there were a series of break ins, which this guy matched.</p>

<p>--right before he was shot, a homeowner saw him peeking through windows of houses.</p>

<p>--he has a criminal record; assault, armed robbery, and suspected to have tried shooting up a high school basketball game because he brought a loaded .38, but was thankfully stopped.</p>

<p>--he was 12 miles from his home, &quot;jogging.&quot;</p>

<p>--he wasn&#39;t wearing jogging gear.</p>

<p>--when the two men jumped out of the truck, they told him to stop and that the police are coming.</p>

<p>--in the video, you can CLEARLY see that he then attacked one of the men, punching him and trying to steal his gun.</p>

<p>--you are allowed to open carry and make citizen arrests in Georgia.</p>

<p>--the police corroborated that he met all the descriptions of the suspect that broke into houses in the EXACT same neighborhood.</p>

<p>--whether you like it or not, this became a clear cut self defense when Ahmaud attacked them. &quot;But MuH fLighT or FiGHt!1!!!11&quot; No. Anyone who didn&#39;t have a motive to escape would have surrendered immediately, but he didn&#39;t because he did not want to get caught by the police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the media was trying to portray this all as a shooting that happened NOW because there&#39;s one serious problem with their narrative otherwise.</p>

<p>there were reports of burglary in february.  arbery is on surveillance video committing trespass, B/E, and attempted burglary, with 2 cops in chase immediately after in february.  the media is saying it&#39;s now may, and there were no reports of burglary since february.</p>

<p>so here&#39;s the problem... most people don&#39;t realize this because the media is actively suppressing it, but the entire event happened in feb.  the shooting you see on cell phone footage happened minutes after the surveillance video.   arbery is still wearing all the same shit as in the cell phone video.   it wasn&#39;t reopened as a case until the cell phone video was released just recently and made it all politically charged.  two prosecutors refused to charge the case as they know it&#39;s unwinnable.</p>

<p>the media can push propaganda all they want, but this is just going to be another michael brown case... thug with a criminal record gets donked for thugging.  the media narrative will break down and collapse because courts don&#39;t play by those rules.  a first year law student could defend this case and win.</p>

<p>edit: for those looking for sauce, there are now two separate videos of different angles, clearly showing arbery, we&#39;re talking at least 4 separate instances of B&amp;E</p>

<p>here&#39;s the surveillance video from minutes before the shooting <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/surveillance-video/itEEj5ftMXkbkKeXrCFBTK/">https://www.ajc.com/news/surveillance-video/itEEj5ftMXkbkKeXrCFBTK/</a></p>

<p>here&#39;s the surveillance video from the nights before, showing 3 separate instances where arbery or someone who looks substantially like him is up close unlawfully inside the building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIuIcqi9sA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQIuIcqi9sA</a>.  the hicks knew about the prior B&amp;Es, they saw it happening and went to effectuate a lawful citizens arrest.  for the state attorney to win this case, the state attorney has to basically argue that citizens arrests in the pro-gun state of georgia do not authorize use or threat of force even when there&#39;s direct probable cause to believe they witnessed the crime themselves, and even when the subject of the citizens arrest is attacking those effectuating the arrest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen that video (And the one from inside the house) and it doesn&#39;t track for &quot;attempted burglary&quot; to me. He walked in, stood around and left. I don&#39;t believe for a second that he was just jogging, but saying that there is footage of him committing attempted burglary is an overstatement. You could build an arguement that he was attempting to steal things or had stolen things, especially if we find more information about the $2500 of fishing equipment that went missing from the boat seen in the other angle, but this footage isn&#39;t enough. </p>

<p>And of course the cops showed up in this footage, the shooters called the police, we&#39;ve always known that cops showed up the location of the shooting. I thought you meant there was some other video of him being chased by the police.</p>

<p>that&#39;s literally what attempted burglary is... entry into a building illegally with intent to commit a crime, especially theft.  he&#39;s on video going back at least 4 separate times.  that&#39;s why when they knew it was happening, they did something then and there.  they attempted a citizens arrest, which under georgia law is legal.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t argue what attempted burglary was - I argued that there is no footage of him committing it. There is footage of him in a house that you could use to <em>build an argument</em> that he was committing it, but you could also use it to build an argument that he wasn&#39;t. It&#39;s evidence but it isn&#39;t footage of him committing the crime. You could just as easily build an argument that he was merely trespassing - if it was an attempted burglary, what stopped him from committing the crime?</p>

<p>I wrote that we&#39;ve always known that cops were there scene, why would I think the video is fake? To clarify, I guess - you said that there was video of him being chased by the police as if it was breaking news when we knew that from day one (even prior to the video being released) so I thought you were referring to another incident in which he was chased by police. We didn&#39;t need video to know that police were speeding down that street in pursuit of a suspect, we heard it on the 911 calls. There is other footage of him being in the house on other dates, so if there was footage of him being chased on previous occasions it would useful information.</p>

<p>he broke the threshold of the building.  it doesn&#39;t matter that the door was open or not even installed.  it&#39;s still legally B&amp;E in virtually every state.  he was trespassing, he crossed the threshold of the building.  that&#39;s B&amp;E.</p>

<p>even worse, the jogging story is fucking ridiculous.  his mother said he ran out for a jog, but he was 10-12 miles away from home depending on the route... basically saying on some random day in the middle of the week he decided to run almost an entire 26 mile marathon if you count there and back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I argued that there is no footage of him committing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>burglary (or attempted burglary) is almost ALWAYS charged along with B&amp;E, and if the B&amp;E conviction lands, so does the burglary.  this is because attempted burglary elements are almost exactly the same as B&amp;E.  they&#39;re far enough away that it doesn&#39;t invoke double jeopardy, but close enough that circumstantial evidence alone will virtually always be sufficient for a conviction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if it was an attempted burglary, what stopped him from committing the crime?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is not necessary to prove.  he might have gotten spooked and just decided not to.  still attempted burglary.</p>

<p>regarding your entire last paragraph, the AJC video is minutes before the shooting.  a black man matching the clothes, approximate height and build, and race of arbery is seen unlawfully entering the house yet again, just minutes before the shooting.  he runs out of the house full speed, and the white guys jump in the pickup and go after him.  minutes later a cop car goes blasting by at high speeds in the same direction.  that&#39;s chasing a suspect if i&#39;ve ever seen one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry man, but you seem to be really stuck on the idea that you can tell with this video what his intent was and I disagree. It&#39;s obvious that the man trespassed but saying that doing so meant he was attempting burglary just doesn&#39;t make any sense - how do we know he wasn&#39;t attempting to murder someone? Or attempting to juggle? </p>

<p>Alabama has a criminal trespass law - I&#39;m not a lawyer, just working off of what I&#39;ve researched in the past few days - and it 100% covers everything caught on video here. Burglary requires intent to commit a felony, which again - you could make that argument when you look at the other incidents, his criminal history, etc. - but there just isn&#39;t any footage of him attempting to burglarize something.</p>

<p>As for the cops, I&#39;ve already conceded that the cops were pursuing a suspect (Aubery) down that street. We knew that before any video was ever released and we could have known it before a single article was ever written about the incident if we just looked at the 911 records. I <em>thought</em>, mistakenly, that you were speaking about an additional example that wasn&#39;t widely known, but apparently not and that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>this is not how the legal system works.  you like so many of these leftoids will use these ridiculously high standards for your social justice bullshit that the legal system does not use.  probable cause certainly does not require direct evidence, and even proof beyond reasonable doubt does not require direct evidence.</p>

<p>intentional unlawful entry across the threshold of a conveyance is always B&amp;E and is almost always sufficient circumstantial evidence for burglary (or attempted burglary).  that&#39;s just a matter of law.  there is no room for you to dispute it.  you can disagree all you want, but then courts will ignore what you say because you don&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about.  trespassing is what happened when he stepped onto the open property.  when he crossed the threshold into the building, that&#39;s B&amp;E.  trespassing is often not charged with burglary, and trespassing is rarely even charged, as it&#39;s only a misdemeanor and in most cases, either the incident is serious enough that they don&#39;t do it again, or they don&#39;t give a fuck and next time they&#39;re doing B&amp;E.</p>

<p>and even then, the video clearly shows B&amp;E regardless of your ridiculous assertion on burglary.  and this is in georgia, not alabama.  in georgia, B&amp;E is a felony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no.  you&#39;re not.</p>

<p>the surveillance video shows he was in the commission of a felony for the 4th time in a week.  two white guys noticed him and he ran, booked it out of the house.  the guys pursued him in a white pickup with two guns.  two cops also pursued but didn&#39;t catch up in time.  this is all on video.  there&#39;s no evidence contradicting it at all.</p>

<p>then there&#39;s a gap.  we&#39;ll get back to the gap in a sec.</p>

<p>then there&#39;s video from a cell phone after the gap.  the video shows a physical confrontation.  arbery and one of the white guys are struggling, and arbery punches the white guy in the head.  the other guy is standing in the back of the pickup, presumably shouting at them.  as arbery is punching the white guy, the white guy shoots arbery.  then the white guy shoots arbery 2 more times.  arbery falls down and dies on the scene.</p>

<p>now the background... arbery has a criminal record for bringing a gun to a high school basketball game.  he dropped it on the ground and someone saw it, and then he was tackled.  in contrast, the white guys not only don&#39;t have a record, one was a former detective.</p>

<p>your proposed rejection of reasonable doubt comes entirely from that gap i mentioned before.  because before that gap, they have the law on their side the entire time.  the context of the cell phone video is completely from the first video and the gap.  so once the white guys get up on the stand and say they pursued him to make a citizens arrest, they told him to stop, and instead he charged them and started swinging, the case is over.  the video even supports this.  their statements to the cops support this.</p>

<p>so now there&#39;s no legal basis to reject what the white guys are saying.  there&#39;s no evidence that contradicts it.  there&#39;s not even a rational basis beyond general skepticism to reject it with any sort of circumstantial evidence.  but general skepticism is not proof beyond reasonable doubt.  there is only the racism-porn fantasy hypothesis that it was a racist modern day lynching.  and there&#39;s no evidence for this.  they don&#39;t have facebook posts about nignogs or any dumb shit that actually racist people say/do.  nothing.</p>

<p>when you add on the fact that this is arbery&#39;s 4th felony in a week ON VIDEO, plus his prior gun crime, plus the white guys&#39; lack of criminal history, the case wouldn&#39;t survive a preliminary motion to dismiss, and certainly not judgment as a matter of law... if it wasn&#39;t for politics.  there is objectively reasonable doubt, and the prosecutors know it.  that&#39;s why they declined to prosecute in february, and after the video came up and political pressure was put on them to file charges, two of them recused themselves.  just like with trayvon martin, they know this is a loser case, and it&#39;s completely the media blowing this shit out, and the facts do not support a conviction.  a law student could defend this case and win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen that video (And the one from inside the house) and it doesn&#39;t track for &quot;attempted burglary&quot; to me. He walked in, stood around and left. I don&#39;t believe for a second that he was just jogging, but saying that there is footage of him committing attempted burglary is an overstatement. You could build an arguement that he was attempting to steal things or had stolen things, especially if we find more information about the $2500 of fishing equipment that went missing from the boat seen in the other angle, but this footage isn&#39;t enough. </p>

<p>And of course the cops showed up in this footage, the shooters called the police, we&#39;ve always known that cops showed up the location of the shooting. I thought you meant there was some other video of him being chased by the police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>--right before the chase, Ahmuad went into a home under construction and stayed there for 3 mins. He only left when he saw the security cameras.</p>

<p>--a week earlier, there were a series of break ins, which this guy matched.</p>

<p>--right before he was shot, a homeowner saw him peeking through windows of houses.</p>

<p>--he has a criminal record; assault, armed robbery, and suspected to have tried shooting up a high school basketball game because he brought a loaded .38, but was thankfully stopped.</p>

<p>--he was 12 miles from his home, &quot;jogging.&quot;</p>

<p>--he wasn&#39;t wearing jogging gear.</p>

<p>--when the two men jumped out of the truck, they told him to stop and that the police are coming.</p>

<p>--in the video, you can CLEARLY see that he then attacked one of the men, punching him and trying to steal his gun.</p>

<p>--you are allowed to open carry and make citizen arrests in Georgia.</p>

<p>--the police corroborated that he met all the descriptions of the suspect that broke into houses in the EXACT same neighborhood.</p>

<p>--whether you like it or not, this became a clear cut self defense when Ahmaud attacked them. &quot;But MuH fLighT or FiGHt!1!!!11&quot; No. Anyone who didn&#39;t have a motive to escape would have surrendered immediately, but he didn&#39;t because he did not want to get caught by the police.</p>
