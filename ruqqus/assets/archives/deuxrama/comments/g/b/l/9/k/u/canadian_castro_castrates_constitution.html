    <div class="md"><p>This was early 90&#39;s and I was a kid, so my observations are abit unrealiable. My mom was doing some liberal arts bullshit phd and writing about cuban culture. So we had enough money not to worry. I loved it as kid. But at the same time it was kinda fucked up for some people, I had friends next door and they where living two kids age 8-10 and two parents in a 20 square meter room they where renting, and then I would come over to visit since it wasn&#39;t crowded enough. I also remember this other lady who broke up with her boyfriend so she and her kid had to move to freakin outside shack. The electricity would go out at night, that was pretty common.   </p>

<p>But at the same time, rarely I feel do you see people malnourished, and they have things like free decent healthcare, its not a meme. I got sick there once, and went to a public hospital. And people are decently educated, free education but your not making money when your done.   </p>

<p>All in all its not horrible living conditions. We do know a bunch of people who moved, if you can go to europe, america, any non fucked up country most people would move in a hearbeat. I have been there since and they are moving forward, but veryy slowly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m tired of this fucking meme. Yes, gamers are hated by society for having no life, while the average person takes orders from the TV 4 hours per day. Gamers are hated on reddit, for wanting our moneys worth. Reddit is super liberal, until a gamer stands up to a corporation. Then it&#39;s oh that virgin gamer is upset that the female body is now covered. No, I appreciate art, culture, and the female body. The gamers rise up meme is hate speech against people with a video game hobby. Should we slut shame, or shame an alcoholic? No? Then STOP this gamers rise up nonsense.</p>
