    <div class="md"><p>Look. Here&#39;s one that I remember incorrectly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/larissafaw/2012/11/21/the-curious-case-of-ed-mcmahon-and-the-publishers-clearing-house">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/larissafaw/2012/11/21/the-curious-case-of-ed-mcmahon-and-the-publishers-clearing-house</a></p>

<p>Like everyone else I thought Ed McMahon was part of Publishers Clearing House. I remember all those TV and radio ads from when I was a little kid. When I learned about this I said, &quot;Really? Oh shit that&#39;s weird.&quot; Then I thought back about the commercials and I do remember the name American Family Publishing. What happened was, they were similar companies with similar names doing similar advertising campaigns and I was little and not really paying attention and <em>I had no idea that they were even separate companies at the time.</em></p>

<p>So, like a normal person who is not retarded, I shrugged my shoulders and said, &quot;Huh, learn something new everyday I guess.&quot; At no point did I think &quot;I must be an interdimensional time wizard! I have ascended!&quot;</p>

<p>Easy. Sometimes people don&#39;t remember things correctly.</p>

<p>You find one person from South Africa over 40 who isn&#39;t a verifiable lunatic or a troll that actually thinks Nelson Mandela died in prison and didn&#39;t become president. Just one. The only people who ever thought that are idiots a half a world away who were too stoned to pay attention in history class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Easy. It&#39;s a very famous statue and it has been depicted countless times in all kinds of media. Like most people you&#39;ve probably seen an artistic representation of &quot;The Thinker&quot; more times than you&#39;ve ever seen the actual stature. You&#39;ve seen it in a Simpsons episode, you&#39;ve seen it in a comic book, you&#39;ve seen an illustration of it on a greeting card, you&#39;ve seen satirical takes and parodies of it. But how many times have you really studied <em>the actual statue</em>. Artists have drawn it in slightly different poses because they are taking an artistic license or they just don&#39;t remember themselves because they&#39;ve never bothered to study the actual statue either. So you&#39;ve probably seen versions of it with his fist on his forehead and you conflate it with the pose of the actual statue which has always had his chin on his hand.</p>

<p>Or you have seen other similar statues that have a hand to their forehead and are conflating that. There are a million knockoffs of that statue. They are things that you buy for your dad&#39;s desk or your mom&#39;s garden. And I&#39;m sure plenty of them are not true to the original.</p>

<p>Or a combination of both.</p>

<p>But the current version I have had no memory of until I saw it again months ago. </p>

<p>The limp back of hand “thinker” has no place in my memory growing up. It was always closed fist to chin. That was the statue. Both in its original form and in imitations. </p>

<p>Unless Rodin had a sick sense of humor and titled his most famous piece the Thinker while having the actual statue doing nothing of the sort; I don’t have any reason to believe it didn’t “change” to its current, paradoxical form in which the figure now has a “cap” sticking off his head and his arm rests on the opposite thigh (try doing any thinking in that pose). </p>

<p>The piece is now preposterous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well isn’t that convenient. </p>

<p>The pose is no longer one trained in thought, featuring a weird cap / protrusion on the head. Suddenly the original title wasn’t even the Thinker. </p>

<p>Why there remains fist to chin and fist to forehead poses (THINKING) is beyond explanation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beyond explanation? Really? Well which do you believe is more likely? The statue has magically changed and everything else stayed the same, or people have thought about the Thinker having his hand on his forehead and that has entered popular culture? This idea of residues and stuff that&#39;s somehow staying the same while things have changed has absolutely no evidence for it. Whereas the fallible nature of human memory is well documented and easy enough to manipulate. I bet if I told you that the Eiffel Tower always had a flag on top of it, you&#39;d be able to picture it clear as day. Jesus.</p>

<p>We don’t know what makes our 3D existence. We don’t know what lies beyond that which influences our world. Physics allows for time to move backward as easily as it does forward, there is no restriction in the formulation of time. </p>

<p>There is no rational reason why there exist countless instances of imitations of a world famous statue being not just depicted “wrong,” but wrong in the same exact way. As if a large swath of people just decided to believe a statue made of rock really should be depicted in a different pose. </p>

<p>Couple that with one’s own personal memory of the statue itself, seen multiple times through many years, to suddenly be different than those MULTIPLE memories leaves one with only one choice. </p>

<p>If this was the only example, sure, confabulation. Bad memory. Etc. </p>

<p>But it’s not. There are more and more changes being discovered. Many have logical residue. Residue that shouldn’t be there unless there was in fact a change to the present reality.</p>

<p>There is no reason for this many examples of a different pose that supposedly never existed. Everyone sees Rodin’s statue if they attended a decent school. Anyone who takes an interest in art will see the statue at some point. </p>

<p>A fist to chin and a open hand in mouth will look quite different from the side. Which is how it is usually pictured to capture the pose more fully. </p>

<p>There’s no confusion here. 
The pose changed.</p>

<p>Not &quot;same exact&quot;, similar. They all remember it incorrectly in similar ways because of similar misconceptions that were caused by similar reasons.</p>

<p>The statue is the same as its always been because you never really studied the actual statue. You and many others just had a preconception of the statue that was wrong and when you saw the real thing it didn&#39;t match your preconception. Instead of just admitting that you had an erroneous preconception you are making up complete nonsense to protect your fragile ego. It&#39;s perfectly ok to be wrong. You don&#39;t look foolish until you are completely obstinate in the face of overwhelming evidence. You simultaneously decry my anecdotal evidence while offering nothing but anecdotal evidence of your own. Neither of those are true evidence. The true evidence is the statue. If you have absolutely nothing to prove that it changed except for your fuzzy memory then you don&#39;t have anything. I can totally picture all three positions in my mind, fist on forehead, fist under chin, and the way it actually is. I can go look at the statue and see the way it actually is. Just because I can picture the other two positions in my imagination doesn&#39;t make it real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can keep coming up with roundabout “reasoning” as to why it MAY be something other than timeline shifts. But the basis for your argument is no different than denying black holes exist UNTIL a picture of a black hole was taken. </p>

<p>If one were to be logical and assess ALL the points of contention, there is reason to be a skeptic of the phenomena to the point of denying its plausibility and in this case, likelihood. </p>

<p>Again, the Thinker is but ONE example. 
Sample sizes matter. And in regards to ME, it keeps growing. </p>

<p>There is no reason for people to keep coming to the same exact “wrong” memories. That implies they had to be referencing a different original from any current version of that thing/place/event/etc. </p>

<p>If you actually took a look into cases with significant residue such as the Thinker, and actually had an open mind to the plausibility, you could not deny it’s existence with any level of confidence. It’s illogical. The EVIDENCE points to a malleable ever changing reality, in all temporal forms.</p>

When he thinks that a big list of shit that people don&#39;t remember correctly is somehow solid-gold proof of the most fantastical explanation imaginable it&#39;s obvious that he has no capacity to even think logically. It&#39;s no wonder he believes it. Sorry bucko, you&#39;re not special, you&#39;re just dumb as a rock.</p>

<p>Give me a break. You just don&#39;t remember things correctly. It happens to everyone. Most normal people just shrug and say &quot;I guess I was wrong and didn&#39;t remember correctly. It was a long time ago and I wasn&#39;t really paying that close attention&quot;. How narcissistic do you have to be to think &quot;my memory is 100% perfect, the whole universe is wrong.&quot; You guys aren&#39;t even crazy, you&#39;re just dumb as hell.</p>
