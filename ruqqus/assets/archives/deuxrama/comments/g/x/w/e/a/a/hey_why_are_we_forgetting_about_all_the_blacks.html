        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, with the recent nonviolent protests .tm and with potential future reparations in sight I think its important to remember that while white people are basically all guilty of being oppressors, we shouldn’t forget the bad black individuals who helped them along. The progeny of these monsters should be held just as accountable since these are potential contras of the BLM movement, we can’t be certain of their loyalties. These “individuals” descend from terrible people and are liable to go back to whistling Dixie and shining whitey’s shoes with one hand while he whips his brothers with the other. The categories of traitors:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Black Slave Owners: Tier 1, code named “snake niqqas” , worst of the worst, basically white people with dark skin. Should have a big white dot tattoo’d on their foreheads to make sure everyone knows about this oreo’s cream filling. Must surrender all belongings  and capital to BLM.  Deported back to Africa. Alternatively placed in a work camp for 25 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Taskmasters/Whip Crackers: Tier 1B, code named “cracker”. These sick MF’s whipped brothas for massa.  More or less just as bad as tier 1 but less monetarily culpable. Forced to surrender 50% of monetary belongings and capital to BLM. Tattoo’d, deported back to Africa. Alternatively placed in a work camp for 25 years. </p></li>
<li><p>House Slaves: Tier 2, code named “house niqqa” or more commonly “uncle tom” . These were the degenerates who cooked massas food and tucking his kids into bed. Some of them even had lots of jungle sex with massa. Anyone with anglo-saxon last names such as “Madison” or “Jefferson” should be suspected of being in this category. Has to pay 25% of paycheck to BLM for life, not allowed to have a driver’s license, not allowed to travel between states without BLM’s permission. Surrenders all children to re-education camps.  Not allowed to buy guns, cigs or 40’s, chicken and pork only sold via limited lottery voucher, grape soda only allowed before 9 PM.</p></li>
<li><p>Traitors: Tier 2B, code named “crab niqqa” these are the guys who betrayed their brothers for a slice of watermelon and a day off. Same punishment as house niqqas.</p></li>
<li><p>Enablers: Tier 3, code named “crab niqqas” these are the weaklings who saw brothas get whipped and did nothing about it, just crawled back into his hut like a crab in his shell. Has to pay 10% of paycheck to BLM for life, has to surrender first male child to BLM at the age of 4 for proper political education.</p></li>
<li><p>African Tribals: Tier 4, code named “spear chuckers” these are the people who often sold brothas to whitey in the first place. Hard to track, thus won’t be punished, but should still be shamed. Force Britain to pay for this category. </p></li>
<li><p>Light skinned bitches who only date white guys: Tier 5. Just no. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So that’s more or less all the counter-revo…er… oppressor class black people who, I think, should also be forced to pay reparations. Just my 2 cents.</p>
