    <div class="md"><p>See, I think Floyd is like Khan in Star Trek where Captain Kirk could have took him back to Earth and put him in prison but what he really wanted was to live on a savage planet full of meth and hookers and no reprecusions for beating up women.</p>

<p>Big Floyd is better off this way. I mean, yes if he&#39;d gone back to jail he would have probably turned out some skinny fucker and made him his bitch and we all know how easy it is to get drugs in jail but really, like all of us, what he really wanted was to fly in space and going to heaven is kind of like going into space. But space like the space in Star Trek cos it&#39;s totally implausible and nothing makes sense like the way all the aliens just look like us except they&#39;ve got pointy ears or fucked up foreheads and apparently their junk is the same as ours cos Spock had a human mother and a Vulcan father (although some people have speculated about <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Vulcan_Genitalia">what alien cocks look like</a> and I guess that&#39;s pretty fucked up). Anyway, if you think there&#39;s any kind of afterlife where you wander around going &quot;oh, that&#39;s nice... I think I&#39;ll go visit my dear friend Tolouse Lautrec this afternoon&quot; then you&#39;re a child. The afterlife is probably a swirling, terrifying vortex of souls dragging us ever deeper into a void of nothingness when the last.of your synapses stop popping and you fade out forever.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what happened to George Floyd when that policeman leaned on his neck. And that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen to you too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is entirely conceivable that on one particular occasion, desirous of advice, of the most immediate and pertinent kind, particularly of a medical variety, or perhaps even more particularly desirous of assistance in achieving such advice, and by the specifics of the particular and essential motivation for such advice finding yourself unable to make more direct missives, at least at sufficient volume to be assured of true communicative clarity, you could happen upon so loquacious an assistant that, even should the request for said advice be accurately transferred, through as it were a misty bog of asides and interrupted clarifications, arising from not only their habitual prolixity, but in fact a total disregard for and even impulse of rejection of what would conventionally be considered the exigency and indeed overweening presumptuous inherent preemptivity (though of course things of that nature are not properly intentional) of the moment of impending mortality, rooted perhaps in the discomfort of that moment, and the denial common but rarely so uncompromisingly expressed, that any given moment should have such decisive finality without awaiting the proper resolution of the narrative structures that we like to believe constitute the nature of endings themselves, such that final moments are commonly adorned and even crowded with a kind of decorative procrastinative maximalism that seeks to sustain the perceived eternity of the present moment by infinitely deferring recognition of the limitations of description itself as an inherent reflection of and reworking of reality rather than it&#39;s constituent part, leading to a constant attempted suspension by your interlocutor of the moment where communication must be transformed into action, even if in a short and fundamentally communicative bridge of dialling an emergency services number, something that will inevitably return to the more comfortable ground of description once more, even should, as I say, such a completion resistant processes finally reach such a resisted state, entering into instead a reportive, clarificative, even journalistic recounting of your immediate troubles and declining condition, then said prolixity would only pass more rapidly into a doomed and inherently delayed repetition of the metaphor of zeno&#39;s tortoise and the famous warrior inexplicably associated both with speed and invincibility, as if previously chroniclers had been unable to decide between distinct reasons for his combative brilliance and the particular significance of a part of the body conventionally associated with motion, such that both metaphors were combined, appropriately in this case, in a surplus of signification of invincibility, while your own quite obvious lack of invincibility progresses gently but inevitably more rapidly than the continuous reporting of this compulsive verbal copyist can transform the essence of events into comprehensible form, always remaining, one step, or in this case, one elongated synonym-searching, and now unfortunately faltering sentence, as the long disavowed gravity of the situation is made increasingly

    <div class="md"><p>More than 100 stealth egg attacks baffle one Euclid homeowner and police (photos and video) EUCLID, Ohio -- An 85-year-old Euclid man&#39;s home has become the target of mysterious egging attacks that began in March 2014 and haven&#39;t stopped. The continuous onslaught of eggs has baffled police, neighbors and local government officials who have tried and failed to identify the source of the attacks that have ruined the man&#39;s home and kept his family on edge. &quot;The accuracy is phenomenal,&quot; Albert Clemens, Sr. said. &quot;Because almost every time when it&#39;s nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit the front door.&quot; Clemens green two-story house sits on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street. He and his wife bought the home as newlyweds about 60 years ago. Though his wife has since passed away, Clemens still lives there with his 49-year-old daughter and 51-year-old son. The house has been pelted with eggs several times a week -- sometimes more than once a day -- for the past year. The attacks always happen after dark and last around 10 minutes each. The family has been awoken as late as 2 a.m. by what sounds like the crack of a gunshot against the aluminum siding or front door. Clemens and police believe the eggs are being launched from a block or two away. The siding on the front of Clemens&#39; home is destroyed, splattered with dried egg residue that stripped off the paint. Other than a few rogue eggs that hit nearby homes, no other neighbors have been targeted. &quot;Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason,&quot; Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser said. Winter offered a short respite for the family, as the egging became less frequent during the cold weather. But both Clemens and police anticipate the attacks picking back up as the snow and ice thaw. An unsolved mystery Euclid police have not taken the investigation lightly. They&#39;ve spent a year doing undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighborhood and even sending eggshells for testing. The department&#39;s entire community policing unit was dedicated to tracking down the eggers at one point. Officers respond quickly to every egging call at the home -- which is less than a mile from the police station. Both Clemens and detectives are at a dead end when it comes to suspects. Clemens had suspicions about a young man across the street who confronted him a couple years ago and asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighborhood. Clemens said that he had started calling police more often as he noticed more crime -- mostly suspected drug activity. Another neighbor Clemens suspected was ruled out when officers saw him standing outside as an attack occurred in the presence of police. Investigators have taken several different approaches to nabbing the eggers, including installing a surveillance camera on the house. Detectives even collected some eggshell samples and tested them in a crime lab. The eggs were traced back to a local Amish farm, but the trail ended there. Clemens says the culprits either have access to a large supply of eggs or are stealing them from businesses that throw them out when they go bad. Detectives have followed this thread, visiting local restaurants and businesses asking about missing eggs. They&#39;ve also tried collecting fingerprints from eggshells, but Houser said that&#39;s an impossible task. When an egg breaks, it releases proteins that destroy DNA. Officers have gone door to door questioning neighbors and handing out fliers. Nobody has come forward with any tips. &quot;The person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped apparently,&quot; Houser said. &quot;I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it.&quot; The guilty parties don&#39;t appear to be intimidated by police interest in the case. An officer last year was taking a report when a barrage of eggs was launched at the house. One hit him in the foot. Houser said he&#39;s never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work. It&#39;s frustrated the whole department, which has dedicated hundreds of hours toward solving the egging mystery. &quot;The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it&#39;s so frustrating that we don&#39;t have somebody right now that we can criminally charge,&quot; Houser said. The culprits will face charges of felony vandalism and criminal damaging, Houser said. Additional charges could be tacked on if investigators find evidence that the attacks are a hate crime. The search continues Clemens is waiting until the perpetrators are caught before he repairs the tarnished siding. His insurance company is refusing to settle a claim until the guilty party is found. He said he used to clean up after each attack, but it became so frequent that he couldn&#39;t keep up. Police initially offered a $500 reward for information, but bumped it up to $1,000 after nobody came forward. That money is still up for grabs. &quot;We&#39;re not going to let it go,&quot; Houser said. &quot;We&#39;ll continue to put effort into it until we figure something out.&quot; Despite all the torment, Clemens said he&#39;d never consider moving from his beloved home. &quot;I like the neighborhood,&quot; Clemens said. &quot;I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house -- but it&#39;s been kind of a nightmare.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ is LORD and SAVIOUR and the light of this world! He as God came into this fallen world 2000~ years ago, born in Bethlehem in what is now Palestine as a male under Jewish authority, and came to reveal his glorious plan of salvation in his 20s, being eventually killed for &#39;blasphemy&#39; by the Sanhedrin in 32/33 AD~, and rose again on the third day, being given all authority on heaven and on earth. However, He was even revealed from the very beginnings through the prophets all through the old testament, an artistic weaving from the master storyteller that tells the story of man falling and Christ picking us up in his love, even laying down his own life for us and our transgressions. And He reaches out to the spiritually needy in his great love! He manifested Himself to me when I was totally down and out, and showed me the depth of his unconditional, PERFECT love that He has for everybody. He is a pure light brighter than any other, but can be looked at forever; He has no deception in Him whatsoever, only the purest love and concern for us; powerful, anxiety-and-pride-killing peace emanates from Him and bathes anyone witnessing His glory into total fulfillment, killing all the ambitions, desires and covetousness of the flesh and being truly satisfied and humbled in His LOVE, and his love alone. His love is literally incredible and can bring ANYONE to tears. He also certainly had a beard when he revealed Himself to me in His majestic glory, but His face wasn&#39;t as clear. This is no lie, or mere hallucination! There is so much more to life than dissatisfying materialism. My life had become completely astray, but God showed Himself to me and it was and is being completely changed by the good King and Saviour Jesus Christ! The rulers of this world want you to believe that Godlessness is the way, the truth, and the life - but it leads to certain death, not only spiritually in this life, but also in the life to come. Please, brother or sister, see what I have to say - the Lord will NEVER force you to repent and believe but would rejoice greatly for you to repent (in your thoughts, in your heart) and come into his arms (2 Peter 3:9, also the parable of the prodigal son, with the father representing Jesus Christ). Read on for the salvation of the Lord! &quot;For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures; and that he was seen by Cephas, then of the twelve; after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. (1 Corinthians 15:3-6) Do you want to be saved and receive forgiveness for your sins, a life with Jesus Christ as King and Saviour who loves you so incredibly much it&#39;s magical, and receive the Holy Ghost of God and eternal life in heaven? Believe the above, which is the Gospel of Christ (that he died for our sins - salvation is by grace, through (our) faith, in Him and his sacrifice for our sins - NOT by works - yet he saves us to do good works that were prepared beforehand by God (Ephesians 2:8-10) and trust in this. More importantly, you must believe you are a sinner: â€œFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)&quot; and that you deserve to die for transgressing the law of God, even currently - no excuses. &quot;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23) I was in the shower, veiny 6&quot; dildo in hand, favorite plug in my ass, as one does. I had already finished bathing and decided to have some fun while the hot water was still there.</p>

<p>I crouched down (the most comfortable position for me in that setting), and tugged on my plug gently. I always love the way the tugging feels. I pushed it back in and tugged again, steadily getting faster until I was fucking myself with my plug.</p>

<p>When I felt like I was loose enough, I set the plug aside and rubbed the head of my dildo against my puffy asshole. After pushing the head past my ring, I gripped the base of the toy and slowly slid it all the way in. By this point in my transition, my bottom growth was big enough for the silicone balls of the toy to touch it from this angle, which is fairly convenient.</p>

<p>I started off by thrusting the toy slowly, but quickly got impatient. In a matter of seconds, one could hear that telltale plaplaplaplaplap from the bathroom door if they leaned against it. The filling feeling, the tugging, and the balls hitting my hard cocklet could&#39;ve driven me mad!</p>

<p>A few minutes in, I could feel my body start to tense and heat up. Me, cumming without a vibrator? More difficult than getting myself to moan out loud. There was no way I was going to stop.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to cum, I felt something familiar in my abdomen, but was too close to make myself stop. My body clenched, and in the same moment I instinctively pushed, I lost my grip on the toy.</p>

<p>Out flew the dildo, out flew a short trail of soft shit, and out flew a loud &quot;Oohh fuuuck yes!&quot;</p>

<p>I kneeled there for a minute, struggling to keep my breath while my body kept aggressively bearing down. Nothing came out after the second push, but I was still squirming.</p>

<p>When the aftershocks finally stopped, I was embarrassed and confused. I had used an enema before the shower specifically to avoid this. But overall, I was satisfied.</p>

<p>It&#39;s taken the past three months for me to not be embarrassed about this fetish. Now scat is one of my go-to genres, and contributing to it has managed to clear up some confusion I had about my preferred role in BDSM and role-play in general. I thought it would make me regress in confidence entirely, but exploring it on my own has made me more sexually confident in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hot take longpost RIP and everything but his death was probably the best way his life was ever going to end and actually a poetic redemption. </p>

<p>You have this guy who was such a druggie peice of shit he put a gun to a pregnant woman&#39;s belly for drugs, he&#39;s locked gets out and tries to turn his life around, fails and relapses on heroin, and is now playing Twister in the middle of the street with a police officer. Sadly if he had survived the incident would have been public humiliation and he almost inevitably would have eventually died from OD as some nameless lost soul people would cross the street to avoid.</p>

<p>But now this random asshole gets to be the face of police brutality advocacy for literally the entire world, has become a glorified martyr saint, and made his entire family/community proud. There are probably millions of posters and flyers right now with the face some random heroin addicted fuck up who had no idea anybody would ever know his name. And he might singlehandedly and totally unintentionally cause a major police reform. Life is weird</p>
