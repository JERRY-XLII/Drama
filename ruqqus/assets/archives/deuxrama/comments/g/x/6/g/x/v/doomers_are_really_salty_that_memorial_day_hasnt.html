    <div class="md"><p>I guess they had a case where they had a lady that only spoke Navajo had covid but couldn&#39;t really communicate her symptoms so nobody knew she had it. A bunch of staff got exposed but only the surgeon ended up getting it. I got tested for antibodies and came back negative.</p>

<p>The shit is weird as fuck for sure. As far as the res goes, I think it comes down to poor nutrition and people living in close proximity to one another. If you have diabetes and vitamin d deficiency, you&#39;re more likely to get it. It&#39;s taking out the poors at higher rates than wealthier people.</p>

<p>Hopefully they come up with a good treatment for it, because poor people are fuckin cool as fuck, in my experience. I wish it disproportionately affected white college liberals, but hey 🤷‍♂️</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>begging her to get people to stop protesting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately this is like begging a withered branch to break off, and expecting the root of the tree to be fine.</p>

<p>Our problem is what provoked the protests. Solve that problem, and we wouldn&#39;t have had protests in the first place. Another problem is obviously hospitals being undersupplied and understaffed, and not being able to handle the influx of patients, particularly due to victims of the pandemic filling up beds. If we had solved that problem, then the exacerbation of the pandemic due to protests wouldn&#39;t matter, as the hospitals could just take on whoever comes in.</p>

<p>But either way, even though we can&#39;t turn the clock back and prevent this, we still won&#39;t get anywhere pointing fingers at protesters. Some may not call her a racist, but they may still call her naive for thinking that putting a protest of this volume on hold just isn&#39;t plausible. And considering every protester you see with a mask, you have to assume they understand the risk and weighed the protests as being more important.</p>

<p>Whether you&#39;re a nurse or not, it&#39;s not difficult to connect the dots and understand why these protests are happening and to just accept it as a necessary movement despite the pandemic. And whether you&#39;re a nurse or not, it would seem much more productive to point fingers at the roots of the problems, not the results of such problems. I mean, if we waved a wand to stop the protests, that would put a bandaid on a scraped arm rather than addressing our head wound. It&#39;s like clearing a chess board of its set pieces--those set pieces will just end up on the board again for the next game. You have to flip the entire board.</p>

<p>And even if you want to avoid the bottom root of the problem, and still point fingers at the surface? You still don&#39;t need to blame protesters. You can just as easily blame the system for not enacting fundamental reform--that&#39;s what the protests are for. If we simply received basic justice, this will all be over. Proposals for fundamental reforms are all over the table from many different established campaigns right now--they just need to say, &quot;okay, we&#39;ll follow these demands--we may not be able to enact them immediately, but okay, we&#39;ll do it.&quot; Imagine blaming Joe Schmo for complaining about injustice, instead of blaming the elite for maintaining such injustice and not doing anything about it. We&#39;re in a fucked situation, but if your sympathies prefer the elite over the common citizen, that&#39;s truly wack.</p>

<p>If you really want the protests to stop, then blame this waiting game phase for change--it&#39;s unnecessary. These protests can stop any day if the elite care for necessary reform. The fact that they apparently do not means they don&#39;t mind if the pandemic is exacerbated. I&#39;d think that&#39;s ground for optimal blame.</p>
