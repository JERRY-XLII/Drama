<p>The autopsy report  from Hennepin County Medical Examiner&#39;s Office concludes the cause of  death was <strong>&quot;cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual,  restraint, and neck compression.&quot;</strong>  That conclusion, death due to heart  failure, differs from the one  reached by an independent examiner hired  by the Floyd family; that  report listed the cause of death as  &quot;asphyxiation from sustained  pressure.&quot;<br/>

<p>The <a href="https://www.hennepin.us/-/media/hennepinus/residents/public-safety/documents/Autopsy_2020-3700_Floyd.pdf">autopsy</a> (the one stated above), where a variety of drugs were found.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/AcBy0Dg">Here</a>  is Minneapolis police department policy in neck restrain (2nd pic) and  some law stuff (1st pic) . It should be noted that this technique is  used in other countries as well, notably Israel.</p>

<p>If Floyd died in those 7 minutes, the 4 police officers would have no idea if he had died. That was just risky and offers an escape for the proof gathered by the autopsy. A large drugged up man was resisting arrest and wouldn&#39;t get inside the police car so they restrained him, absolutely nothing wrong there.</p>

<p>Why he took meth with a heart and blood as bad as his is anyone&#39;s guess. My question is how he drove to the store in the first place.</p>

<p>This is when non-emergency medical should have been called because it was obvious this was gonna take a while.</p>

<p>refuses to get in the car, with force because he&#39;s strong, he claims claustrophobia; anyone can bullshit that excuse</p>

<p>naturally police restrain him so he would fall unconscious because he is resisting arrest</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When they started the choke they should have monitored his vital signs. They couldn&#39;t have known his blood and heart were fucking horrible and that he was so drugged up it was a miracle he <em>drove</em> to the location. <em>But</em> they should have anticipated a problem because obviously the guy was not sober.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the cops were innocent, the guy kneeling is a piece of shit, and the guys around him cowards for not stepping in. But it&#39;s incredible how a drugged up pornstar with a history of cardiovascular health issues dying is what causes black people to burn down major cities.</p>

<p>Not the black teenagers going to university getting murdered, not some completely innocent targets. This morally grey character who, had it not been for the fact that he took drugs and had a bad heart, would have survived this ordeal, <em>and</em> was guilty of resisting arrest, taking meth, and using counterfeit USD bills. This is the man twitter has chosen to call their saint. It&#39;s mindblowing that out of all the unjust and brutal police killings, America explodes over this one, where there was -- compared to other times cops kill black people -- relatively little done wrong.</p>

<p>they are the ones who claim he said he cant breathe before they put a knee on his neck</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know which is the correct to way to apply that technique. As i understand it the purpose is to make the other person unconscious. If he did it wrong then sure he can be charged for involuntary manslaughter. But if he did it correct how is he himself liable more than the police department?</p>

<p>Anyway he&#39;s getting acquitted since the charge has been updated to 2nd degree which means they have to prove intent to kill.</p>

<p>That&#39;s one minute of the nine. He did when the medics told him to. If they wanted him to do it sooner they should have told him exactly after they checked for pulse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok a pic of something isnt reliable proof because it can just be made up i need actual proof</p>

<p>the police themselves checked for a pulse before calling for an ambulance, there was no reason to restrain him beyond this point especially when he was yelling before that he cant breatje</p>

<p>both autospy&#39;s</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Experts hired by George Floyd&#39;s family and the Hennepin County Medical Examiner have concluded his death was a homicide, but they differ on what caused it.
The independent autopsy says Floyd died of &quot;asphyxiation from sustained pressure&quot; when his neck and back were compressed by Minneapolis police officers during his arrest last week. The pressure cut off blood flow to his brain, that autopsy determined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will do it, they are doing it all across the western world because the media has decided that the history of all our countries is &quot;racist&quot;.</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t you seen how how hard journalists are trying to tell us that we should be ashamed of Europes expansion westwards, how europeans have &quot;genocided&quot; the natives, how all american countries, especially the US, are founded on &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;bigotry&quot;. Some already support eradicating americas commemoration of it&#39;s history pre-1960s, although it&#39;s a fringe opinion, like removing bismarck statues in germany, it is without a doubt growing.</p>

<p>The Confederates come first since it&#39;s acceptable to shit on them now. After that they will come for other &quot;controversial&quot; things. Even non-confederate stuff has been removed. Although it&#39;s still few and far between.</p>

<p>And btw, some things they remove is fucked up, like simple commemorations of the dead and plaques which say &quot;famous confederate lived here&quot;. They don&#39;t want to simply destroy things praising the Confederacy, which is kinda understandable, but also everything that even mentions them in a neutral manner.</p>
