    <div class="md"><p>The only coherent leftist ideology is vaginocapital:</p>

<p>Right and left directions are now mixed. Look at the election results in Italy. There won a mixture of left and right populists. In relation to family policy and human rights, these populists are right. In relation to the economy-left. The current power in the USA and Europe, on the contrary, in relation to the family and traditional values, is the left. And in relation to the economy - right. They use the left values, so that people would become disunited. Disunited people without tradition unable to make a revolution .</p>

<p>Can manosphere units be merged?
I do not really understand the types of Western Masculism. Here I am a left-wing liberal communist who says that the vagina of a woman is the means of production. This is a means of profit, a means of obtaining money. And therefore the theory of Karl Marx is applicable to the vagina.
We are a minority. Lesbians and LGBTs are also a minority. The government deprives Inzell&#39;s vital needs. Government discriminates us. The government discriminates against a minority. the government violates our civil rights because we are a minority.</p>

<p>I am from Russia.</p>

<p>📷</p>

<p>Hi guys! I am from Russia and I hate Putin and all our corrupt power. In our country, the government puts the Incel&#39;s and Redpills in prison. I have Redpilled since 2009. I hate Wagecuck. I am an antifeminist. And in my country, I fight for the rights of men. I am a incel</p>

<p>Here I am a left-wing liberal communist who says that the vagina of a woman is the means of production. This is a means of profit, a means of obtaining money. And therefore the theory of Karl Marx is applicable to the vagina.</p>

<p>What happens under capitalism? Wagecuck&#39;s trying to get sex. They make a lot of money. They are slaves of women. Women tell them what laws to create.</p>

<p>Women like such laws. Women fuck with chad.This is how the sexual revolution was created. Wagecuck&#39;s government made a sexual revolution.Previously, every man had one woman for life for free. Now women have a choice. And they fuck for free with a small number of men. This small amount is 10% of all men.Chad not only fuck with women. Chad is getting rich. Because they are beautiful. Because they are selfish. Because they are daffodils. Because they are psychopaths. They do not cry because of someone else&#39;s disfavor.</p>

<p>Chad&#39;s dark triade in buisness. Darc tiiade in sex. Beautiful egoists - narcissus-psychopaths fucking women. They have a lot of money.</p>

<p>Society does not need morality. Society does not need kindness. Society does not need good people. Society needs beautiful egoists. society needs monkeys. Society needs animals.Sex is a vital need. But it is available only to animal bindings and egoists.</p>

<p>There are two ways out of this situation.</p>

<p>Lifetime monogamyPromeskuit:</p>

<p>Everybody fuck everybody. The second option is the socialist principle. every man has the right to have sex. This is a vital need.</p>

<p>We are a minority. Lesbians and LGBTs are also a minority. The government deprives Inzellov vital needs. Government discriminates us. The government discriminates against a minority. government violates our civil rights Sex is a vital need. But it is available only to animal bindings and egoists.</p>

<p>There are two ways out of this situation.</p>

<p>Lifetime monogamyPromeskuit:</p>

<p>Everybody fuck everybody. The second option is the socialist principle. every man has the right to have sex. This is a vital need.</p>

<p>Now it is impossible to imagine this. Because modern moral principles do not allow us to think about it.But 80 years ago it was impossible to imagine that we would live such a free sex life.And what will happen to us in 80 years? I&#39;m talking about the distant future. In which all men will have the right to have sex. This will be the world proletarian sexual revolution! But by then, all the post-Christian nations will be extinct?
I&#39;m glad you laugh. It is good that at least someone answered me. I almost can&#39;t speak English. And I can say something wrong</p>

<p>This is the communitic theory of vaginocapital.In the USSR in 1920 there was the theory of the &quot;glass of water&quot;. This theory has not received development. But it was the first sexual revolution. A communist&#39;s women should be as easy to make love with any communist&#39;s man as drinking a glass of water. Seriously speaking , This is a very complex theory. To tell her, you need 500 hours. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Kollontai">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Kollontai</a>
This is a very incomprehensible theory. And I do not write in English. I would understand me, you need to ask simple questions that can be answered &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; Or you can ask questions that I can answer in simple words
To explain this theory, you need to talk via video link? I need to draw diagrams and algorithms to draw this theory. I can draw a lot of diagrams. 100 A4 sheets .
Perhaps if I had a year of free time, I could even create a mathematical theory of vaginocapital. Marx wrote the book Capital. I would write a book &quot;Vaginocapital&quot;</p>
