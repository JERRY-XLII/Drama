    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Looks like it&#39;s going to be another night on the Snorlax for me, wife brought home another man and isn&#39;t letting me watch this time.&quot;</p>

<p>I mean just looking at this effeminate guy in that curled up position, and then seeing his punk/butch ass wife, I already feel like I know everything I need to know about their &quot;open marriage&quot;. I feel like I can be almost certain that he&#39;d be perfectly happy in a monogamous relationship, and she&#39;s just a whore that&#39;s been railed so many times her brain is incapable of monogamy. He just listens to everything she says, and she can convince him of things even she doesn&#39;t believe because she&#39;s either more intelligent or better spoken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don’t keep people who don’t need to be hospitalized in a hospital, there is a very different standard of care and expense involved - no to mention hospitals being dangerous places for the elderly to begin with.</p>

<p>Sending them back to nursing homes was a normal move <strong>provided</strong> you make sure they are willing and able to abide by proper quarantine procedures. Which, turns out, they were not. But that’s what we do with any other communicable illness.</p>

<p>Really the solution is a separate set of quarantine facilities. The state was probably too strained to arrange for some when shit hit the fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the elderly are infected with COVID as it is, what else are you worried about happening to the elderly at the hospital? Double COVID? With the trillions of dollars they are spending, they could have put the infected elderly in a school gym for all I care. It&#39;s absolutely insane to coerce homes to bring known infected into the most vulnerable places in the country. Nursing homes have staff that don&#39;t speak English getting paid 8 dollars an hour. It&#39;s pants-on-head retarded thinking a facility that isn&#39;t built for quarantining can just start a fool-proof perfect quarantine. You&#39;re also saying this like every single state made the same decision. 45 states didn&#39;t make this call and 49 states aren&#39;t currently forcing this retarded order. Every time someone makes a dumb fucking call like discouraging mask use or letting infected staff continue working at these homes (as long as they&#39;re asymptomatic lol) there&#39;s always some shill saying, &quot;Well in the perfect America that exists in my head, this plan would have worked.&quot; You don&#39;t have the nursing homes in your imagination- you have the homes that exist in real life. Stop holding water for these idiots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who are getting discharged have mild symptoms - which would not be improved by picking up one of the innumerable pathogens swarming in our hospitals.</p>

<p>As usual we have a retarded piecemeal approach to this. Some states simply do nothing, which leads to discharged patients scrambling looking for a nursing home that will take them. Some, put down requirements for nursing homes and expected them to do their jobs. A few smarter ones under less pressure set aside separate facilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it doesn&#39;t matter that they have mild symptoms- the pathogens at the hospital they might catch aren&#39;t as concerning as the one causing the pandemic. Yes, they can catch the flu and ringworm but you should be more worried about the olds giving it to people in his nursing home. The superminority of places that made that order are not as equally stupid as states that did nothing. It&#39;s far better that families struggle to place their olds and people scramble to find a home that will take the old than have every fucking facility take COVID-positive biobombs back into their facility.</p>

<p>New York didn&#39;t just do that. They also allowed COVID-positive workers to continue work at these homes based on the fucking stupid idea that if they were asymptomatic they might not be contagious. These assholes are expecting us to shut down all businesses and destroy people&#39;s lives but these inconveniences you&#39;re bringing up in an alternative policy would be UNBEARABLE. We will stop all medical procedures and cancer screening for 2 months but man oh man, do we really have to worry about asymptomatic staff? That&#39;s a risk our brave governor is willing to take.</p>
