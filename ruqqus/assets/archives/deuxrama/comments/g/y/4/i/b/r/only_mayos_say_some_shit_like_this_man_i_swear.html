<p>Being this much of a reditor should be grounds for immediate execution.  How disgustingly sheltered removed from reality do you have to be to see a picture of men walking towards their death, and the first thing you think of, because it&#39;s the closest experience you have to their lives, is that their fucking socks are wet and that sucks? I bet you that not a single guy on that beach cared about his fuckong socks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course his biggest worry is dying without “getting laid” and growing a beard. Plus his absolute ignorance of how the Normandy landing came to be isn’t shocking either. The Germans didn’t have years to prepare and fortify the beach, they were spread thin and believed an attack would come from much further north. Even on D-day the Germans didn’t believe the allies would attack Normandy and didn’t bother sending viable reinforcements, thinking it was a ploy. The actual invasion was conducted on a really foggy day, there wasn’t much charging into battle, it was a bunch of soldiers lying on the beach waiting for the Germans to run out ammo.</p>

<p>To be fair, that was the biggest worry of many of the guys who stormed Normandy, too.</p>

<p>But other than that, yeah. As a serious post, this is accurate. People generally don&#39;t just charge machine gun fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out this post, it also has other stats like 90% of Americans saying they&#39;d rather lose to Nazis than end segregation and excerpts by George Patton, WW2 US General: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The3rdPosition/comments/gg1ado/the_great_betrayal/">https://www.reddit.com/r/The3rdPosition/comments/gg1ado/the_great_betrayal/</a></p>

<p>Had the WW2 vets known what would become of their nations, they&#39;d either refuse to fight the Axis or join them.</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Nicholas-Pringle/dp/1409271749">&#39;The Unknown Warriors&#39;</a> by Nicholas Pringle is a collection of letters from Second World War veterans with memories of wartime and thoughts on life since the end of the war and the country today.</p>

<p>Here are some excerpts regarding the book, taken from a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1229643/This-isnt-Britain-fought-say-unknown-warriors-WWII.html">news article</a> about the same:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is extraordinary about the 150 replies he received, which he has now published as a book, is their vehement insistence that those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the war would now be turning in their graves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;I sing no song for the once-proud country that spawned me,&#39; wrote a sailor who fought the Japanese in the Far East, &#39;and I wonder why I ever tried.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They feel, in a word that leaps out time and time again, &#39;betrayed&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Immigration tops the list of complaints.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#39;Our country has been given away to foreigners while we, the generation who fought for freedom, are having to sell our homes for care and are being refused medical services because incomers come first.&#39;</strong> Her words may be offensive to many - and rightly so - but Sarah Robinson defiantly states: <strong>&#39;We are affronted by the appearance of Muslim and Sikh costumes on our streets.&#39;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a group, they feel furious at not being able to speak their minds. They see the lack of debate and the damning of dissenters as racists or Little Englanders as deeply upsetting affronts to freedom of speech. <strong>&#39;Our British culture is draining away at an ever increasing pace,&#39; wrote an ex-Durham Light Infantryman, &#39;and we are almost forbidden to make any comment.&#39;</strong></p>
