        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I initially couldn&#39;t finish the Berserk anime when I first started it. It was so deeply frightening and sad, I just couldn&#39;t do it. Then I started to understand Guts. His struggles, his desire to find love and peace. I saw a large man, both in mass and stature, who feared being vulnerable, who feared any connections that would rend him from what he knew: his training, solitude, and tarnished sense of safety.  </p>

<p>I am a pretty big guy. I&#39;m over 6&#39;5 and workout frequently. I get attention from people for being bigger, some of it positive, mostly negative. I&#39;ve had people call me a &quot;freak&quot; before. People will often challenge me to fights just to prove something, specifically when I&#39;m at college. I&#39;ve accidentally hurt people before when I was messing around, or too much when they tried to fight me. I was made fun of a lot during my childhood; people called me dumb, R*tarded, anything to deprive me of joy. I started to believe it. I gave up. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t take it anymore, so I decided to make myself a weapon. I began weight lifting and martial arts.  but it didn&#39;t shake the fundamental fear I still held that people were there to hurt me and cause me pain, so closed myself off. I hid and prayed that people would just leave me alone. </p>

<p>I eventually got to college, where I started to go to parties. I got to one called &quot;Dress to get Laid&quot;, and I didn&#39;t have the confidence to go crazy with it, so I wore my standard outfit of jeans, a Henley, and Boots. I go to school with mostly women, so I get a fair amount of attention, the majority of which don&#39;t respect that I have a girlfriend. I&#39;m moving upstairs with a drink in my hand, when two girls grab me, one my chest and pecs, the other my crotch. I froze. I didn&#39;t know what to do. If this were anyone else, I would hit them. But I&#39;m a white guy on a college campus in 2015, with two women who are both about a foot shorter than me touching me and giggling. I have little confidence and a lot of fear. So I freeze. It happened 3 more times each getting more and more aggressive and violent. </p>

<p>When you get sexually assaulted, you feel hopeless. You feel frail and weak. I shut it off. I decided that it didn&#39;t happen. It couldn&#39;t have. But it came back. Two semesters later, after someone I thought was a friend kissed me without my permission, I panicked and locked myself in my room. I did not attend class for the next couple days, I blew up on a friend of mine for putting his hand on my shoulder. </p>

<p>It was during those days, isolated, terrified, and desperate to feel like I could have agency again, that I tried Berserk again. Watching Guts&#39; struggle with Gambino, being raped by Donovan, being closed off and terrified of a world that we perceive as malignant and only wants to desecrate us. When Guts found trust in the BOTH, I found hope in my friends. When Guts found love, acceptance, and peace in the embrace of Casca, I realized I could find love again in the arms and smile of my girlfriend, the love of my life. </p>

<p>No story better illustrates how vital love can be. No story shows how beautiful the world is when there are people who can make you better, and that you DESERVE love. </p>

<p>Always. </p>

<p>Thank you Guts. </p>

<p>Thank you Miura. </p>

<p>Thank you all.</p>
