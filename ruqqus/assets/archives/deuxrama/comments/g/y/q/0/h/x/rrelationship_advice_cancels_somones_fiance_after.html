    <div class="md"><p>“So yeah. Throwaway bc she&#39;s on reddit. She and I have been together for two years, but until a few months ago we lived in the same city we went to uni in. In February, we moved back to the city where I grew up because we both got jobs here. This meant that she only just met a lot of my old friends a four months ago. We&#39;ve also been plnning the wedding for much of this time and I&#39;ve decided on having six groomsmen to match her six bridesmaids. My brother as my best man, and then my two uni best friends and three of my closest mates from school. It&#39;s one of these three she&#39;s got an issue with. My friend Archie is a trans man. He and I have been close friends since we were toddlers cause we grew up next door to one another. He came out and started transitioning at 18. He&#39;s never been anything less than our bro and we&#39;ve always loved and supported him cause he&#39;s our mate, you know? The only thing that&#39;s kind of a caveat with Archie is that once, when we were 16 and very drunk at a house party, he and I hooked up. This was before he was out and before I knew he was a bloke. I&#39;m straight, so obviously now I know he&#39;s a fella I&#39;d never do anything with him again and we really are just mates now. Anyway. Archie is one of the mates I&#39;ve chosen as a groomsman. My fiancée knows we hooked up tht one time as kids, and she&#39;s furious that I&#39;ve asked him to be a part of the wedding. It&#39;s not just thr she&#39;s mad, though. She&#39;s taken to actively misgendering Archie, asking why I want her to be a part of the wedding, saying maybe she should be the one I&#39;m marrying if I&#39;m so in love with her. She&#39;s told several people that I&#39;ve asked my &quot;ex girlfriend&quot; to be in the wedding but that I think it&#39;s okay because, and I quote &quot;she is pretending she&#39;s a man now&quot;. I&#39;m honestly so upset by this. I love Archie, of course I do, he&#39;s one of my best mates. But I&#39;m not in love with him and never have been. I&#39;m also utterly disgusted that she keeps misgendering him on purpose and talking shit about him in general. She&#39;s never given any indication she might be transphobic before, but this has made me see her in a totally new light. Would I be overreacting if I broke up with her and cancelled the wedding over this? Has anyone had a similar experience at all and managed to talk it through or whatever? I really just feel like I need help.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What a faggot, for once gussy is actually correct. Its not appropriate for someone you fucked to be at your wedding, especially as a bridesmaid or groomsman. GF is entirely in the right which means this guy is an absolute failure of a male. The fact that this fag is defending his friend rather than sticking up for his wife because &quot;idc if a guy who fucked her before goes to my wedding&quot; shows shes better off leaving.</p>
