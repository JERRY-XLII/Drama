    <div class="md"><p>Yes you do, you fucking imbecile. If you are rejerking you have to put /rj in front of it and if you are not rejerking you put /uj in front of it, although some people don’t use /uj but yes you need to put /rj on comments that are rejerking. There are people who come here to un ironically say that shit so that’s what /rj is for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for once i was able to see the guy in the pic while he was trying to use his laptop in the public, it was hard for him to type down on his laptop since his armpits were too muscular to let his arms to move freely,</p>

<p>&quot;may i help you?&quot; i asked because i did not like to see people like this to be in pain, he ofc agreed, as a skinny soy consuming incel i was i started typing as fast as possible, the words he said would be written less than a sec. when all the typing ended i looked at him. he was pleased. he asked me if i could join him at his place so he could get much more typing done and also he would pay me goo money. i accepted.</p>

<p>after a month or two of typing my fingers were hurting. i could not type any more, i had to see the doctor. i was in his house so i told him that i am taking that day off and i am going out to visit my therapist. he did not agreed. instead grabbed my hands and said &quot;incel, are you going to leave me like this? i could see the glaze in your eyes every time you saw my nipples and i really needed someone to suck them outta milk for me.don&#39;t you want manly milk?&quot;</p>

<p>i was confused, what the fuck was going on? i could not comprehend.</p>

<p>&quot;FUCK&quot; he shouted. &quot;FUCK I DON&#39;T CARE, CHOOSE ONE: GET RAPED ANALY, OR SUCK MY NIPPLES&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;what the fuck? what the actual FUCK?&quot; i said.&quot; I&#39; leaving, i will even return your money, fuck you, and fuck my kindness for people like you&quot;</p>

<p>but that was too late. he grabbed my wrist by one hand and punched me in the cheeks by his other hand. it was painful. i could not resist him. i was laying on the floor that he bend his knees. grabbed me by shoulder and raised my head to his nipples.</p>

<p>&quot;SUCK IT&quot; he shouted. &quot;SUCK IT or GET FUCKED&quot;.</p>

<p>I had no choice. i had to do it. i closed my eyes. opened my mouth and put one of his nipples in my mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;FUCK AH FUCK&quot; he was muttering and moaning.</p>

<p>i was sucking his nips and after a fucking 7 minutes his manly juice started to fill my mouth. i do not mean cum. i mean literal man milk. i was milking him. it was awful. while i was doing this he was jerking his small white penis. and he was about to cum he turned me over and put his veiny but small dick me. and filled my now no longer virgin hole.</p>

<p>it&#39;s been 5 years after that incident. but every fucking time that someone posts this picture i flash back to those days and cry. </p>

<p>Fuck you sincerely.</p>

<p>The true incel</p>
