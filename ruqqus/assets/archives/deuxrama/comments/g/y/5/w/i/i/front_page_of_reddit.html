    <div class="md"><p>Even then, the number of people doing this kind of shit in Berkley is <em>minuscule</em> compared to the absolute amount of people who have been saying they <em>would</em> do it if a riot ever broke out. Same way with how people who shoot up schools and mosques are an absolutely <em>tiny</em> portion of the alt-right.</p>

<p>And jury&#39;s also still out on how many of the arsonists are actually linked to antifa, too. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if on one of these incidents, some of the guys - in an unexpected fit of self-awareness - ask &quot;wait... how is burning these buildings down supposed to help the revolution?&quot; and the others just turn around and are all like: &quot;revolution?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s exactly why it&#39;s important to remember they&#39;re not the majority. </p>

<p>Whever a riot or mass shooting happens, both the right and the left - not even just the antifa and the alt-right - will try to convince everyone these attacks were <em>definetly, 100%</em> politically motivated, and not just the result of some lone wolves. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll do this even when it should by all accounts be counterproductive to them, like with how the major parts or the left never once tried to denounce the rioters as people who are taking advantage of the BLM cause for their short term gain, instead always trying to ignore the riots, defend them, or blame them on &quot;white supremacist instigators&quot;.</p>

<p>Why? Because both want to politicize tragedies so they can get control over the outrage, and leverage it to get more influence. For them, admitting the apolitical nature of these incidents is actually <em>worse</em> than quietly accepting responsibility for them, because then at least they&#39;ll continue to live rent-free free in everyone&#39;s brains, even if not in a positive way.</p>

<p>Pointing out that the majority of the people involved in this shit care just as much about the political side of it as the people who just want to grill (and then somehow getting that message out to as many people as possible), though, stops that shit right in its tracks.</p>

<p>Had the WW2 vets known what would become of their nations, they&#39;d either refuse to fight the Axis or join them.</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Nicholas-Pringle/dp/1409271749">&#39;The Unknown Warriors&#39;</a> by Nicholas Pringle is a collection of letters from Second World War veterans with memories of wartime and thoughts on life since the end of the war and the country today.</p>

<p>Here are some excerpts regarding the book, taken from a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1229643/This-isnt-Britain-fought-say-unknown-warriors-WWII.html">news article</a> about the same:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is extraordinary about the 150 replies he received, which he has now published as a book, is their vehement insistence that those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the war would now be turning in their graves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;I sing no song for the once-proud country that spawned me,&#39; wrote a sailor who fought the Japanese in the Far East, &#39;and I wonder why I ever tried.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They feel, in a word that leaps out time and time again, &#39;betrayed&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Immigration tops the list of complaints.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#39;Our country has been given away to foreigners while we, the generation who fought for freedom, are having to sell our homes for care and are being refused medical services because incomers come first.&#39;</strong> Her words may be offensive to many - and rightly so - but Sarah Robinson defiantly states: <strong>&#39;We are affronted by the appearance of Muslim and Sikh costumes on our streets.&#39;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a group, they feel furious at not being able to speak their minds. They see the lack of debate and the damning of dissenters as racists or Little Englanders as deeply upsetting affronts to freedom of speech. <strong>&#39;Our British culture is draining away at an ever increasing pace,&#39; wrote an ex-Durham Light Infantryman, &#39;and we are almost forbidden to make any comment.&#39;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the Axis would&#39;ve won WW2, then the Cold War would be between the US and Germany + Japan, that would mean the biggest enemy of US would not be the communists, but the fascists, this would push the US further to the left, than it is now, so it would have the opposite effect than you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s incorrect. Before the declaration of war, the US got on quite well with Nazi Germany so assuming the soldiers did as they said they wished and never participated then there would have been no war. If this was the case then the US likely would have continued to get on quite well with Germany. The real cold war would have been the axis powers as well as the US against the Communists. </p>

<p>The axis powers did attempt to dissuade the other world leaders from war. Especially the UK and the US due to good relations with the US and mixed relations with the UK due to the origins of the royal bloodline. Obviously however, war profiteers pushed the UK and the US to declare war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if they would even bother with that. If the Nazis won the Western front and held control of France, they could effectively move a large number of their forces and take western Russia up to Moscow and if they did this effectively and with enough supplies, I have a feeling they would declare it their own territory. There would be no advantage in pursuing every russian troop to the east but by conquering up to Moscow, they would have taken most locations of strategic importance. </p>

<p>While there would no longer be communists, due to a prior good relation with the US, I can&#39;t see either side turning on each other. The US knows they have a defensible position that the Nazis would never be able to take. They also have a lot that the Nazis would like from foreign trade such as oil which wasn&#39;t being extracted by the axis in the middle east as fast as the Nazis would have liked. They likely would have became trade partners because, assuming segregation never ends or anything of the sort then the US wouldn&#39;t be too ideologically opposed to a powerful Christian country in Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you figure? First, the US would be defeated under a Democratic President. Second, the US wouldn&#39;t have the power to fight a Cold War against a victorious Germany or Japan. They wouldn&#39;t have bases all over the planet. They wouldn&#39;t experience the post-war recovery in anything like the same way.  Meanwhile, Germany and Japan would be divvying up the USSR and China, building bases throughout South America and Africa, and generally just ruling the planet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely that over time, the US would adopt a fascist or fascist-sympathizing government by now just to get along in that alternative world order.</p>

<p>Had the WW2 vets known what would become of their nations, they&#39;d either refuse to fight the Axis or join them.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Warriors-Nicholas-Pringle/dp/1409271749">&#39;The Unknown Warriors&#39;</a> by Nicholas Pringle is a collection of letters from Second World War veterans with memories of wartime and thoughts on life since the end of the war and the country today.</p>

<p>Here are some excerpts regarding the book, taken from a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1229643/This-isnt-Britain-fought-say-unknown-warriors-WWII.html">news article</a> about the same:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is extraordinary about the 150 replies he received, which he has now published as a book, is their vehement insistence that those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the war would now be turning in their graves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;I sing no song for the once-proud country that spawned me,&#39; wrote a sailor who fought the Japanese in the Far East, &#39;and I wonder why I ever tried.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They feel, in a word that leaps out time and time again, &#39;betrayed&#39;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Immigration tops the list of complaints.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&#39;Our country has been given away to foreigners while we, the generation who fought for freedom, are having to sell our homes for care and are being refused medical services because incomers come first.&#39;</strong> Her words may be offensive to many - and rightly so - but Sarah Robinson defiantly states: <strong>&#39;We are affronted by the appearance of Muslim and Sikh costumes on our streets.&#39;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a group, they feel furious at not being able to speak their minds. They see the lack of debate and the damning of dissenters as racists or Little Englanders as deeply upsetting affronts to freedom of speech. <strong>&#39;Our British culture is draining away at an ever increasing pace,&#39; wrote an ex-Durham Light Infantryman, &#39;and we are almost forbidden to make any comment.&#39;</strong></p>

<p>&quot; <strong>Antifaschistische Aktion</strong> (German: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German">[ˌantifaˈʃɪstɪʃə ʔakˈtsi̯oːn]</a>), commonly known under its abbreviation <strong>Antifa</strong> (German: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German">[ˈantifaː]</a>), was a militant anti-fascist organisation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic">Weimar Republic</a> started by members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany">Communist Party of Germany</a> (KPD) that existed from 1932 to 1933 &quot;</p>

<p>They are essentially nothing else than KPD suckers. The same americans, brittons etc. tha landed on normandy would be happy to shoot Antifa members on sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s exactly why it&#39;s important to remember they&#39;re not the majority. </p>

<p>Whever a riot or mass shooting happens, both the right and the left - not even just the antifa and the alt-right - will try to convince everyone these attacks were <em>definetly, 100%</em> politically motivated, and not just the result of some lone wolves. </p>

<p>They&#39;ll do this even when it should by all accounts be counterproductive to them, like with how the major parts or the left never once tried to denounce the rioters as people who are taking advantage of the BLM cause for their short term gain, instead always trying to ignore the riots, defend them, or blame them on &quot;white supremacist instigators&quot;.</p>

<p>Why? Because both want to politicize tragedies so they can get control over the outrage, and leverage it to get more influence. For them, admitting the apolitical nature of these incidents is actually <em>worse</em> than quietly accepting responsibility for them, because then at least they&#39;ll continue to live rent-free free in everyone&#39;s brains, even if not in a positive way.</p>

<p>Pointing out that the majority of the people involved in this shit care just as much about the political side of it as the people who just want to grill (and then somehow getting that message out to as many people as possible), though, stops that shit right in its tracks.</p>
