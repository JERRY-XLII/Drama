    <div class="md"><p>My 2010 went like this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>2010 I was fan fagging about transformers </p>

<p>2011 I shat bricks over dark of the moon</p>

<p>2012 I started getting into lego </p>

<p>2013 is a when lego went full furfag. It is also the year I discovered youtube, oh and I became a minecraft fag.</p>

<p>2014 is when my autism peaked when I became a five nights at fantards fag also I was fapping hard to the new american godzilla. Also I started watching pewdiepie. It is also the year I started fapping to porn. </p>

<p>2015 is when I discovered reddit and mausterbauted furiously over undertale. Also the year I found about Deviant art</p>

<p>2016 is when I became a indie games #1 fantard after cuphead came out and when I found out about Ori a year after it came out also I discovered ED I would soon completely forgot about ED until 2020. I started fapping to furry porn this year.</p>

<p>2017 I was living under a rock spending my entire time watching youtubers like leafy and pyrocynical also jack, and mark, and felix. I also started becoming active on reddit this year mostly on ryiff and rfnaf and other shitty free mobile game reddits. Also i spent alot of time lurking sdp and looking for dicklet cope across reddit.</p>

<p>2018 the year of my joining of incels, i discovered them after I saw so many redditors bitching about the incel boogeyman and got curious and I lurked there forms and I hesitated but eventually I joined braincels and I spent all year on those motherfuckers and I forgot about all my prior interests. It was good talking to them though, since they were virgins they were always willing to reply to off topic posts which made them so fun to interact with and were the next best thing to having friends irl. This is also the year I started observing the alt right due to incels introducing me to it and I made an account on voat.</p>

<p>2019 braincels got banned and I spent most of the first months lurking .co before I got over the incel fad and moved on. But I still missed those incel bastards. I started becoming more active on voat.co this year and alt right subs on reddit. I learned about some forbidden knowledge and started crying like a cuck. This is also the year I started fapping to bbc porn. After getting neglected and made fun of by alt righters I kind of stopped caring about everything and was nearing a midlife crisis entering 2020. I became a conspiracy theory fag at saidit.</p>

<p>2020 I know its not part of the decade but I will just talk about it anyways. Depressed and with no forum to go to I was utterly bored I heard that the sequel of Ori was coming out this year and I also discovered Hollow Knight the same year and heard its sequel was coming out this year too. I also started getting into fnaf again out of boredom to see what was going on with the games only to still see the creator still milking the series with shitty made games. Then thats when it hit me, I remembered an article that I found funny that was insulting fnaf, their fans, and their creators, I remembered that I read it on ED and started binging on ED articles till ED turned me so blackpilled I got bored of reading ED. Then I signed up to KiwiFarms only to feel the same disappointment I did with ED. Then I finally started getting into anime years after I constantly told myself that I would never get into anime as it lools dumb and all the characters look the same, however I changed my toon when I found out about nekomimi girls. Then I started watching anime only to feel satisfyingly cringed out. I am still waiting for the Hollow Knight Sequel. Then I find DeuxRAMA by accident that I cant remember I think I was searching for furrygay porn and this showed up lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is all my decade lol, I don&#39;t keep a good track of my life and I cant remember what happened years ago yeah this is mostly about me fanfagging over video games and whatnot but video games are practically my life and the only thing I do.</p>

<p>Lol I didn&#39;t realize I wrote a wall of text.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the wall. I used to bounce around through different communities as well back in 2014-2016 until I got sick of it. I never did get into any of the blackpill communities though because I&#39;ve always felt like the absolute pursuit of &quot;truth&quot; is pretty damaging as far as that stuff goes. I also feel like everyone who ever got into anime above the age of 15 thought weebs and all things anime related were cringe as fuck before they took the 2Dpill lol. I&#39;m sure 14 year old me would neck if he saw the shit I would watch and enjoy just a few years later. </p>

<p>Oh also if you&#39;re just getting into anime you should watch Code Geass, that shit is good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still probably will still bounce around gaming communities though. Sadly video games just dont last that long or have an ever lasting impression, but I still remember Ori and Hollow Knight mostly due to their amazing sound tracks.</p>

<p>Well I didn&#39;t know what I was doing at the time when I got myself into blackpill communities, it all coincidentally started when I started having massive penis size insecurity then I started getting bombed by blackpills without even realizing it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That is exactly me lol. Also If child me saw that I started devoloping into a furfag in the 2013s I would have felt weak as well, 2014 fnaf tard me would also scream at me for watching anime(the irony). </p>

<p>Code Geass huh? I will see if I can start getting into it, after I finish all my animal girl animes first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No actually the furfaggotry came first because I wasn&#39;t getting any girls. Then when I noticed alot of people talking shit about dicklets irl and in porn videos is when I started getting insecure and found refugee for a while in sdp and later braincels.</p>

<p>I started BBC porn after I became an incel in 2k18 and started getting into the alt right as I pretty much saw bbcs as chads(tyrones as incels will call them although many incels deny the power of bbc) as they are polyamorous and unfaithful and known for being womanizers on top of that they have larger cocks. I guess I just have been deprived of women for so long I just started getting weird fetishes. I should have cleared this up in my original wall of text but there is just to much stuff to remember off the top of my head to give an accurate description of my decade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I am a jbb guy, but there is no way I believe in jba lol no way incels always made fun of curries and rice 24/7 and asians are known for being weak soyboys, manlets, backward retards, and small dicked. </p>

<p>I mostly go to 4chan random for that stuff now, but I want to forget about it tbh what I really noticed is that I just like the way bbc rough fucks mayo foids and I want to do that too, I am way more interested in the pussies tbh. With other porn it feels like the man is lightly tapping the woman but with BBC it feels like the man is going all out on the mayo whore. Also it is kind of a male market competition kind of thing you get horny out of frustration when you see your being beat in the sex value market you know what I am trying to say?</p>
