    <div class="md"><p>Think about it moids: why should ANY foid worth her salt choose a pathetic weak m*Le over a strong GVLDEN RETRIEVER? The GVLDEN RETRIEVER doesn&#39;t worry about silly things like &quot;red flags&quot; and &quot;children&quot; and &quot;boob size&quot; and &quot;weight&quot;; They see a tight, wet opening, they stick their dick in it, it feels good so they keep on going. They pound into your girlfriend with such force she is moaning, begging for more doggy cock. She is damn near pissing herself, but the GVLDEN RETRIEVER doesn&#39;t stop. His knot swells. Your girlfriend, mind blanked by orgasmic bliss, is bound to the GOLDEN BVLL for up to an hour while his Chad knot shrinks down, and her vaginal muscles milk every drop of GVLDEN RETRIEVER spunk. She will never look at you the same way again. Sex doesn&#39;t feel the same. She is &quot;tired&quot; most nights, yet you can hear the whimpering and moans from the bathroom when she takes Sparky in the bathroom to &quot;take a shit with company&quot;. She tells you to go in the other room and &quot;jerk it or something&quot;. You are ashamed. You are weak. You are crushed. But she will never love you again. Sparky plays with his chew toy.</p>

<p>Her stomach is swelling. That is strange, you think, as you two haven&#39;t had sex in about 4 months and you had just gotten a vasectomy, per r/childfree advice. She tells you it&#39;s hormones, but you see the worry in her eyes, the fear lying behind her nonchalant expression. Fucking Sparky, looks up at you and almost smiles. The fucking MUTT, having the nerve to smile at you. In a time like this? Why are you so fucking angry at this dog? What did he do?</p>

<p>5 more months has passed. The &quot;bump&quot; on her stomach is huge now. You worry it may be a freak-case tumor or something of the like, but you now are pretty sure she cheated on you at some point. With who? When? But most importantly, why? Sparky looks at you again, but this time, his face is blank. He shits on the floor.</p>

<p>It is now obvious she&#39;s in labor. She decided against going to the hospital, for reasons you were unsure of. Probably read a Reddit post on tub births or something. In any case, she is in pain, and you are doing as much as you can to help her birth the baby, even though you just know it isn&#39;t yours. That&#39;s okay though. When you find out who the father is you will kill them. How could he do this to your girlfriend? Why did she let him? Where is he? What is his race? Is his cock bigger tha-</p>

<p>The baby is born. Or, rather, 6 babies are born? They are... furry. And yellow. And their ears are quite large. Holy shit. The fucking dog. Sparky. They look just like him! Except, they have human characteristics. They are grotesque to look at, you are sick to your stomach. You want to scream, to cry, to beg her to kill them, but she doesn&#39;t. She isn&#39;t doing much of anything actually. Just staring at them, with cold, dead eyes. She holds two up to her swollen breasts. They suckle, and whimper. They are alive. Sparky shits on the floor.</p>
