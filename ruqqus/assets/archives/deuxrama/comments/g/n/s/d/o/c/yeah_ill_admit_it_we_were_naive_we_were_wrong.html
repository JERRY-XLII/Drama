        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;ll admit it. We were naive. We were wrong.</p>

<p>We never expected that this level of evil was even possible; we assumed it couldn&#39;t exist. Such malice was unfathomable. We were ignorant, and in our ignorance we ignored what was right in front of us.</p>

<p>We once thought Voldemort was the ultimate evil... at least... until 2016...</p>

<p>That was the year everything changed. Deatheaters looked like pixies compared to the likes of Kushner, Pompeo, and Miller. Azkaban seemed like a hell on earth- until we saw the cages the undocumented children were kept in. After that, Azkaban may as well have been a theme park.</p>

<p>I remember when I first read about the Dark Mark that Voldemort branded onto his followers, and I recoiled in fear. But the Dark Mark was nothing compared to the willing self-defacement of the MAGA hat. A true symbol of evil- not burned into a person- but taken upon themselves willingly. It dwarfed the Dark Mark entirely, and pointed out for all the world to see what true evil looks like.</p>

<p>As naive as I was, I once believed we had our own Albus Dumbledore in a man named Mueller. But Mueller eventually proved himself to be another Death Eater; another pawn of the great evil that plagues us still.</p>

<p>Voldemort may have murdered James and Lily Potter; but the evil that plagues us now has murdered nearly 100,000 Americans with his own personal, devastating plague. A plague in which there is no cure; a plague fueled by malice and despondency.</p>

<p>I wish I could claim that my fellow Americans are under the Imperius Curse. That they didn&#39;t truly vote for such evil of their own volition. But I can&#39;t. Deep down I know that somewhere in the darkest depths of their hearts they wanted this.</p>

<p>Harry, forgive us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I’ve met people like this, in real life. They truly never measure up in anything they do. They can’t maintain eye contact, they don’t ever really accomplish anything, this is his only outlet because he’s too spineless, weak, and awkward to do anything else. He goes from sub to sub crying about some kind of criminal high fantasy as if anyone would ever notice him in real life. Someone’s probably bullying him as we speak lmao.</p>
