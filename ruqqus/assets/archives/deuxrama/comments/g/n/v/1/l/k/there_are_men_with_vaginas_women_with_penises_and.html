    <div class="md"><p>Other games worth of honourable mentions:</p>

<p>The Postal series, specifically Postal 2, which has a similar premise as based Hatred but with more epci funnie comedy, plus it&#39;s essentially DeuxChad simulator.</p>

<p>&quot;wow, this is just like real life, and i thought arma was a realistic game...&quot;</p>

<p>I thought to myself as I encountered a femoid, peed in her mouth, soaked her in gasoline whilst she was puking, lit her on fire, and watched as she flailed around for not having bussy.</p>

<p>&quot;...this is literally how I behave irl&quot;</p>

<p>Every single interaction in the game could be given the caption &quot;DeuxChads when they encounter x&quot;. It also has a really schizo early 00s vibe where everything and everyone is depicted as trashy, giving you the immersion of being a sociopathic DeuxChad misanthrope in the comfort of your home without having to go out and tedpost on people irl like you usually do. Hell, it&#39;s even all about mail packages!</p>

<p>What&#39;s that? You&#39;re a DeuxStacy and not a DeuxChad? Plus you&#39;re a massive simp since you are literally 15 and obsess over a Brad like all other girls because you&#39;re not that different to them despite being a member of epci 4chan supr sikrit club but on leddit aka DeuxRAMA? Well have I got a game for you:</p>

<p>YanSim. Absolutely degenerate. Super girly. Unfinished. Cringe anime. Dev is a clown. Game literally doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p><em>But you can off people in violent ways and the main character has a mad superiority complex plus everyone around you is dummy stupid...</em></p>

<p>&quot;fuck it, im installing this free unfinished debug build of this stoopid fucking game&quot; is what you are thinking right now. Still gonna DM cum chalice memes to the dev doe. He&#39;s super memeable, especially after going from copelord incel to full on whiteknight after he found out the majority of his playerbase were foids lmao.</p>

<p>Any other based DeuxRAMA required gaming vidya with a mass killing theme?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know and I think he&#39;s abandoned that measurement because the first rival isn&#39;t complete. Major visual rework, a new gamemode, dozens more characters, and about 12 new elimination methods have been implemented tho. </p>

<p>Ngl I think development is stalling, even tho I have a longer attention span because I play Cortex Command, a 1999 game that was in development for 20 years and ended up absolutely legendary for the time it started, but lost hype due to, well, being 20 years in development and extremely niche, so I should be on YanDev&#39;s side, but nah. </p>

<p>Game will be done in 2054 at this rate, I hope. And I&#39;m not saying that as a meme, that&#39;s a calculated projection. In fact it might be more because I haven&#39;t calculated the time Yan &quot;consoom the seminal goblet&quot; Dev spends on &quot;fan interaction&quot; (protip it&#39;s just seething on stream, look up &quot;yandere dev cuphead rage&quot;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based. I also liked doing that and filled them with napalm bombs/molotovs if ronin for that tomahawk missile vibe. Unironically a really good bunker infiltration tactic, because seconds after the destruction of the rocket, its wreck is really heavy and can punch quite far into a wall before stopping. Then you can just dig out the fragile wreck with as little as a light digger or just bullets, and move inside the bunker. </p>

<p>Or you could be really devilish and download the redcoat militia mod from workshop, buy a Viceroy transport (basically the twin-engined transport but insanely beefy, can survive high speed collisions and small arms fire) filled with napalm bombs, and just hover over enemies to kill them with your engines, and even dig holes if needed. If it gets shot down it pulls a martyrdom and spreads a ball of flame over the terrain it self-destructs over. Its wreck is pretty heavy and will push several feet into soil, but gets stopped by metal, which means it can conveniently block an entrance into your bunker if it hits the remaining metal pipeline. Saved my brain many times by sacrificing them to become one with the structure. The aircraft itself is expensive tho, costs like 460 bombs not included, but it&#39;s worth it considering the disproportionate amount of damage it can deal to the enemy or the safety it can grant your bunker. Oh, it can also knock other aircraft out of the sky because it has side armour that protects its engines.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the cheap way of bombing stuff. Take the tiny dummy aircraft that costs jack shit, fill it with bombs (even standard works), slow it down as it enters (it&#39;ll be really heavy), then scuttle mid-air to season the ground with explosions, like a chef spreading salt and pepper over a fine dish.</p>

<p>Cortex Command is now official DeuxChad required gaming, not only because it&#39;s based and underrated, but because it got that intergalactic empire human supremacy vibe + trade star Midas is a literal joo joke. Discuss favourite factions.</p>

<p>Fun includes: Shooting up the silver weeding of your grandparents, killing Jesus, getting a heart attack and going to heaven, killing God, going back to life, throw a sick ass party in a church, kill Pennywise the dancing clown and a whole circus, kill the giant reincarnation of pope John Paul II, killing pope Francis because he is the antichrist, and lastly , killing baby jesus before he was born in the womb of Mary, therefore preventing christianity from ever existing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so where&#39;s the based part? Am I supposed to laugh? Sounds pretty redditor-like to me, like someone on /atheism decided to make another wholesome 100 John Wick movie starring Keanu Chungus but instead he kill le unebin boomer Christianity (if you don&#39;t imagine sunglasses emojis when the redditor is explaining this in their sales pitch you should) and non-wholesome social constructs designed to oppress the poor leftoids. </p>

<p>&quot;Will you please think of the poor leftoids? We need to remove the only meaningful opposition to degeneracy in Europe throughout history (before it got infiltrated and cucked), for the proletariat, man! Come on have some empathy, they&#39;re poor!&quot; I bet you voluntarily hand in your weapons to the police and create a borderless world-state with universal healthcare when the game ends too lmao. Definitely a &quot;massive cope with the fact that you got roasted by your fam after arguing theism at the dinner table&quot;-type game. Cheers for the recommendation though, I&#39;ll try it at some point, hopefully, perhaps.</p>
