    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like anti-incels are allergic to actual good advice on how to get girls at this point. Look, I get it, not all guys seem to be lucky with looks, so most of the time they make up for it with confidence and personality (yes personality matters, but not the kind IT thinks), but when you have no looks, nor confidence, what usually happens is these guys who have nothing going for them tend to either be incels or white knight mangina SIMPS.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
By the way, the whole list thing has some weird things on it, but the advice can be summed up as &quot;Don&#39;t seek female approval, validate yourself&quot; and something along the lines of &quot;Be interesting to women&quot;. Mostly good advice, and of course they would ignore that because Neekolul said SIMPing was king shit, and they believed it. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTear/comments/gmbgb3/calling_out_an_incel_and_a_simp_50th_post/">In fact, a female user was calling out a simp and an incel...</a> and of course downvotes would ensue, because of course only simps would be offended by the word simp.
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
Which is funny, because all my experiences with women always seem to be that they come right to me, and sometimes they would pry into my life to be a part of it. I never showed interest in them at all.  </p>

<p>I never noticed that&#39;s what women like until early in 2019 when one of my roommate&#39;s friends said something along the lines of that.  </p>

<p>Look, I know essay posting is seen as a cope thing from the leftoids, but I am incredibly amused, and I have to go into detail. This whole simp thing is breaking the simps of Reddit, it&#39;s making them unspool, and I&#39;m just laughing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the same boat as you. My GF was the one who suggested we be in a relationship back in high school, and I said yes. I know someone who was a bit of a dark personality still having girls orbiting him and stuff like that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what I mean when I said how personality matters, but it isn&#39;t the one IT thinks.  </p>

<p>It has less to do with &quot;being nice&quot; and instead being more confident, have a little mystery, stuff like that. Give them something to try and figure out. The problem with simps and incels always seem to be this: They reveal themselves too early, and absolutely blow it, in essence they become too boring to women.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the only advice they have. Not anything about having interests or hobbies, nothing about working out or self-improvement, nothing about socializing (after quarantine of course), careers, financial advice, just &quot;shower and be nice&quot;.  </p>

<p>If you followed these dorks&#39; advice, you would score at best a 2 or a 3, but who would want that? I&#39;d rather go volcel, they practice martial arts and kill Wako Pirates.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even being nice is no guarantee. In fact, being nice is not a personality.
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
Incels listened to something like IT&#39;s advice years ago. They were told by movies and the media if they were losers and have such a boring and milquetoast personality, they will get the prettiest girl in High School if they&#39;re nice enough, if they simp hard enough, while Football Johnny doesn&#39;t win in the end.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
However, they didn&#39;t get the prettiest girl, they didn&#39;t win in the end, Football Johnny won, and these boring guys are pissed off because they were lied to their entire lives. That&#39;s why incels hate Chad, because they convinced themselves that Chad is the enemy you should never aspire to be.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
My advice for incels reading this: I know you&#39;re going to ignore me, I know you&#39;re gonna think of me as a &quot;douchebag Chad&quot; while discarding my advice, I don&#39;t really care. I&#39;ll tell you this, dating is gay and stupid, I&#39;ve never cared about getting girls my entire life, I&#39;d rather be recluse in my own hobbies and interests, and other things going on in my life. So what happens from there? Girls pretty much gravitate towards me because of that.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
So you&#39;re a virgin, who cares? Sex is extremely overrated. Having a girlfriend isn&#39;t even worth it anymore due to the times we live in. Life isn&#39;t some 80&#39;s teen movie, getting laid is not important at all.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
However, if that&#39;s what you really want, then so be it. I&#39;m no PUA, and you don&#39;t have to change into Football Johnny, but stop calling yourself an incel, stop saying you can&#39;t get laid, stop saying you&#39;re subhuman, because the more you say it, the more true it is. Start thinking of yourself as the opposite, and you will see results.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
I know you&#39;re gonna ignore my advice, but you know I am right.</p>
