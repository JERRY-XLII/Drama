<p>That&#39;s more about perceived humiliation and how eating pussy is just really gay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they have the choice, they prefer female genitals that are mutilated: either via &quot;old-fashioned&quot; techniques like in some African and Islamic communities or via &quot;modern&quot; cosmetic surgeries that some women in porn have performed on them. </p>

<p>Not aware of that hmm</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this is always a kind of sexless, &quot;genitalless&quot;, pedophilic look of a pink little slit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well ghenitals do suck tbf, that&#39;s why bussy is where it&#39;s at. Of course a vagina that looks more like bussy is preferable, although it should ultimately be rejected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men also hate any amount of natural body hair on women although (or because!) it is a sign of sexual maturity. Men hate normal amounts of body fat on women although (or because) it is a sign of sexual maturity and fertility as well.</p>

<p>No we see it as too masculine lmfao dork</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men want babies with big tits.</p>

<p>Big tits which in no way are more primary signs of maturity and fertility than thick pubes? </p>

<p>Whoops, plot hole :o</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what do they want to sexually do to these babies with big tits? Fuck them in the ass, fuck them in the throat, beat, rape, torture, and humiliate them until they cry.</p>

<p>Male sexuality is nothing but fetishized violence against women. They love anal sex because it is hurtful to women and doesn&#39;t give women a chance to orgasm themselves. And the moment they realized that some women actually enjoy giving blowjobs have they come up with &quot;throat fucking&quot; and &quot;deep throat&quot;: they HATE women, they HATE female bodies, and they HATE the idea that a woman could enjoy sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These strawfems&#39; selective exposure to men and pr0n is highly bizarre, what else can one say here lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is often said that &quot;Porn tells lies about women, but it tells the truth about men&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, all those O-face compilations, squirting, moaning (to the extent the overacted cases have joined the group of frequently ridiculed features of that medium), high popularity of sensual lesbian videos etc. all unambiguously show how &quot;men hate when women enjoy sex&quot;.</p>

<p>This is a very old, established radfem buzz phrase of course, they just keep repeating and circlerubbing it and stuff like &quot;all porn is violent&quot; because they&#39;ve seen other radfems say it and that&#39;s literally the totality of their exposure to the world, from what it seems - listening to other radfems lmao</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the truth is that if you take the brutal anal/throat penetration out of male sexuality, what&#39;s left is men casually beating, hurting, whipping women. The distinction between &quot;vanilla&quot; and &quot;kink&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense in the case of men. It&#39;s just a matter of degree. &quot;Vanilla&quot; men want to rape women and beat them - &quot;kinky&quot; men want to rape women and beat them and electroshock and water torture and mutilate them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how does that explain all the millions of.. nah f it I just can&#39;t I can&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men are not attracted to actual female bodies. Men only enjoy the idea of DESTROYING female bodies: both through absurd beauty norms that effectively destroy these bodies and turn them into absurd dolls and through sexual practices that are always about hurting, beating, whipping, raping, anal fucking, throat fucking female bodies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let&#39;s say it&#39;s true and men prefer some kinda non-wizard slave non-meatflap gussy to &quot;real&quot; tripod hangers, that still has nothing to do with wanting to destroy things, right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying preferring straight white teeth and applying bleach and braces to ensure those preferable forms is = HATING human teeth and WANTING TO DESTROY THEM.</p>

<p>So is it just me or is the author here not being entirely sensible and logical here?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men are MONSTERS. There is some creepy shit in nature: viruses and predators and parasite larvae that eat their host alive. And, of course, other animals also rape women. But nothing is as cruel and disgusting as the human moid: at least a lion doesn&#39;t masturbate over the idea of a female lion being torn to pieces by an elephant or whatever. A predator just wants to eat you, a coronavirus just enter a cell nucleus and replicate ... but the human moid gets erections and masturbates to the thought of women being humiliated and tortured and hurt until they cry and bleed or even die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The general truth of &quot;evil humans are the vilest creature produced by evolution&quot; put through strawfoid filter mao</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.) Men do not like women.</p>

<p>Men do not feel attracted to real women. And men do obviously not LIKE women. They hate women so much that the moment women like something, men hate it: if women like flavored-coffee drinks from Starbucks, men hate it BECAUSE women like it. (As if bacon and bacon memes are funnier or better than women making memes about pizza or enjoying pumpkin-spice lattes!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So like when men started scoffing at 50 Shades but evidently retained their exclusive affinity for hardcore s&amp;m pr0n do you mean? :o</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When women join a fandom, men leave because the moment women like it, they start hating it. Some sociologist has coined the term &quot;gender pollution&quot;: it is a sexist term itself but it describes a real phenomenon: the more women enter a particular space (e.g. a profession or a hobby), the more it is &quot;polluted&quot;, the less it is valued and the less people in this job get paid. I think in some Eastern European countries this is actually the case with doctors even: but as there are many women in this field - both among nurses as well as among doctors - doctors are also not valued anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Foids just ruining everything, what can you do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moment women became good in school was the moment boys increasingly dropped out. Men now associate doing your homework and reading books with women - and they rather ruin their lives than to be engaged with something women like! So instead of doing their homework are they now playing video games 24/7. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, so our slacker laziness is all the foids&#39; fault too eh? Didn&#39;t even know that :o</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But now women have obviously started playing video games as well. So now they become mass shooters because they hate the idea of female video game characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when the Columbinecels were inspired by the Matrix, it was because they liked the idea of male shoot-em-uppers and wanted to imitate them, and hated female ones and wanted to imitate them?</p>

<p>That.. makes sense! Whoa</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3.) Men do not love women</p>

<p>Winston Churchill famously said that you have the Germans either at your feet or at your throat. </p>

<p>Now, I’m not sure about the Germans, but I think that this is definitely true for males: they are always either at your throat or at your feet. Males fall in &quot;love&quot; with e-girls … but the moment they find out that those women already have boyfriends they want to kill them. (I’m not even sure if I have to put &quot;love&quot; in quotation marks here because the idea of a REAL love in contrast to quotation-marks-love feels a bit like the idea that only &quot;men&quot; in quotation marks are toxic and shitty while REAL men are all these heroes and these supermen…)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>:o</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think pornsickness and “lovesickness” are, in a way, two sides of the same coin. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the name of that coin is: gussy sickness. Definitely needs to go lol</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Love” feels like the surrogate religion of a secular age. I’m not a Buddhist but I agree with this part from a text, explaining why this religion is critical of the concept of “romantic love”: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>​</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. Just consider how many males murder others and/or end their own lives because of love. Just like being pornsick makes it hard for males - and for women - to develop a realistic understanding of human sexuality with its possibilities and limitations, being “lovesick” makes it hard for males - and for women - to develop a realistic understanding of human relationships. People these days expect love to do what previous generations expected miracles and gods to do. “All you need is love” vs “All you need is Jesus”.</p>

<p>There are also studies that show that males fall in love easier and earlier than women. And they surely fall out of love easier as well. Males are like the flickering flame of a candle that burns brightly for a second and then goes out again. This is why it’s so super common for women to think that they do not know their husbands anymore because they feel that these males are completely different persons suddenly. </p>

<p>Males can be lovesick and pornsick at the same time. They masturbate to torture porn in one moment, and the next moment they write a 20-page love letter to some e-girl and emotionally vomit all over them, confessing their undying love. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now she contradicts her own earlier statement that all mens do is h8 women and wanting to kink them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Many women receive as many rape threats as they receive cringe love letters in which males emotionally vomit all over them.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>:o</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And one moment later do they already want to kill those terrible “e-thots” again: males are always either at your throat or at your feet: the romantic concept of &quot;love&quot; is a literary construct at best and a religious tool at worst but it&#39;s simply not true that men are able to &quot;love&quot; women in the sense women dream about being loved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If love is just this made-up construct, does that mean lesboids are unable to love other lesboids in the sense that those same lesboids dream about being loved by other lesboids?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men are not attracted to actual women.</p>

<p>Men do not like actual women.</p>

<p>Men do not love actual women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2nd sentence cracks me up because she&#39;s telling on herself even more. The only reason she&#39;d say something like that is because she&#39;s got a used up Arby&#39;s Beef N&#39; Cheddar between her legs and wants to pretend that&#39;s how her genitals are supposed to look.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t be bothered reading further than that.</p>
