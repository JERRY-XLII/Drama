    <div class="md"><p>A significant portion of that sub was desperate for Bernie to win so that they could get treatment for their gender dysphoria, and that so they could get their college loans cancelled. If we take off the lolcow demeanor for a second, many of them are facing the prospect of either being stuck with a mental condition they can&#39;t afford treatment for and will torture them until they decide to kill themselves, and some have realized that they are stuck in debt slavery to their $200,000 art school degree for the rest of their life until they die. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve made some terrible choices and been in some bad places but not eternal permanent student debt, LOL. I&#39;m finna get a bachelors for like $10k if not for almost nothing in the state of MA with the free associates I already got, cuz the govt gibs me dat. Fucking rekt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand anxiety over repaying massive student loans but gender dysphoria isnâ€™t a real thing. You donâ€™t just naturally feel like you were both the wrong gender. Itâ€™s a fake disease and a fad; itâ€™s a hobby for them, a cure for their boredom.</p>

<p>If any of them do commit suicide while wearing a dress, then itâ€™s because they coincidentally have depression (a real mental illness). The dress has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>And besides, even if they had access to free healthcare, they either wouldnâ€™t seek treatment for their depression, or they would end up talking to a quack doctor/psychologist who would indulge their dress-wearing instead of treating whatâ€™s really wrong with them. Either way, the result is a trip to Nordstromâ€˜s for a high tensile strength belt and a sturdy rafter.</p>

<p>Bernie could not save these people. They were doomed by the Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>of course it&#39;s a real thing u boomer, even some 3rd world iron age shitholes recognize transgenderism in some form. the exhibitionist freaks have no bearing on the real people with real problems.</p>

<p>otherwise you are getting into the mental gymnastics of saying it&#39;s just depression where it just happens to revolve entirely around gender identity. the reason you don&#39;t indulge body dysmorphia with plastic surgery is because it doesn&#39;t work, not because of some moral retarded jugdgement</p>

<p>Biden will do equal or more harm, and has done more harm in the past. Supporting either president compromises any authority you have and makes you a simp and perpetual cuck forever. Voting in 2020 is lib shit and you are still stuck in electoralism, a fundamentally flawed and liberal strategy because you are too comfortable and cowardly to properly radicalize</p>
