Gee I really do appreciate the thought and all the psycho analysis I really hope that you didn’t have your parents spend their hard earned money on the pressures education to choose a field where you know you’re just bad at it. But my U Penn degree and cybersecurity masters, would beg to differ, thanks for playing though. You realize this sub is nothing but a bunch of fat losers who cry about peoples opinions on the Internet in a sub with other big fat fatties. This sub is the equivalent of a liberal rally, just on the Internet and with less of a purpose and is way less respected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone needs to take a knee. Its fucking 2020, we fucking fapping to VR now and youre still gonna hate just because of a bullshit reason like skin color?. if you wanna hate people, hate for the 10,000+ other reasons people hate everyone for. Race isnt a fucking issue. Its fucking melanin you motherfuckers.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb9_qGOa9Go">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb9_qGOa9Go</a> edit2: FUCKING LISTEN!</p>

<p>EDIT: Fucking lazy motherfuckers, here i typed it out for you.</p>

<p>When you have a civil unrest like this, there are three types of people in the streets. There are the protesters, there are the rioters and there are the looters.</p>

<p>The protesters are there because they actually care about what is happening in the communities. They want to raise their voices and they&#39;re there strictly to protest.</p>

<p>You have the rioters, who are angry, who are anarchists, who really just want to fuck shit up and that&#39;s what they&#39;re gonna do regardless.</p>

<p>Then you have the looters and the looters are almost exclusively just there to do that, to loot.</p>

<p>Now people are like; &quot;what did you gain?&quot; &quot;Well what did you get from looting?&quot; I think that as long as we&#39;re focusing on the &quot;what&quot; we&#39;re not focusing on the &quot;why&quot; and that&#39;s my issue with that. As long as we&#39;re focusing on what they&#39;re doing, we&#39;re not focusing on why they&#39;re doing it and some people are like; &quot;Well those are people who aren&#39;t legitimately angry about what&#39;s happening, those are people who just want to get stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>Ok, well then let&#39;s go with that let&#39;s say that&#39;s what it is. Let&#39;s ask ourselves why in this country, in 2020, the financial gap between poor blacks and the rest of the world is at such a distance that people feel like their only hope and only opportunity to get some of the things that we flaunt and flash in front of them all the time is to walk through a broken glass window and get it. That they are so hopeless that getting that necklace, getting that TV, getting that change, getting that bed, getting that phone, whatever it is they&#39;re gonna get. In that moment when the riots happen, If they are presented an opportunity of looting, that&#39;s their only opportunity to get it. We need to be questioning that &quot;why&quot;.</p>

<p>Why are people that poor. Why are people that broke. Why are people that, that food insecure, that clothing insecure, that they feel like their only shot, that they are shooting their only shot by walking through a broken glass window to get what they need. And then people want to talk about &quot;There&#39;s plenty of people who pulled themsevles by their bootstraps and got it on their own, why can&#39;t they do that?&quot;</p>

<p>Let me explain to you something about economics in America and I&#39;m so glad that as a child I got an opportunity to spend time at P.U.S.H. where they taught me this is that; We must never forget that economics was the reason that black people were brought to this country. We came to do the agricultural work in the south and the textile work in the north. Do you understand that. That&#39;s what we came to do, we came to do the agricultural work in the south and the textile work in the north.</p>

<p>Now, if right now, if I right now decided that I wanted to play Monopoly with you and for 400 rounds of playing Monopoly, I didn&#39;t allow you to have any money, I didn&#39;t allow you to have anything on the board. I didn&#39;t allow for you to have anything. And then we played another 50 rounds of Monopoly and everything that you gain and you earned while you were playing that round of Monopoly, was taken from you.</p>

<p>That was Tulsa.</p>

<p>That was Rosewood.</p>

<p>Those are places where we built black economic wealth. Where we were self-sufficient, where we owned our stores, where we owned our property and they burned them to the ground.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s four hundred and fifty years. So for 400 rounds of Monopoly, you don&#39;t get to play at all. Not only do you not get to play, you have to play on the behalf of the person that you&#39;re playing against. You have to play and make money and earn wealth for them, and then you have to turn it over to them. So then for 50 years you finally get a little bit and you&#39;re allowed to play and every time that they don&#39;t like; the way that you&#39;re playing or that you&#39;re catching up or that you&#39;re doing something to be self-sufficient. They burn your game. They burn your cards. They burn your monopoly money and then finally at the release and the onset of THAT, they allow you to play and they say &quot;Okay, now you catch up.&quot;.</p>

<p>Now at this point the only way you&#39;re gonna catch up in the game, is that the person shares the wealth, correct? But what if every time you share the wealth there&#39;s psychological warfare against you to say &quot;Oh, you&#39;re an equal-opportunity higher&quot;. So if I play 400 rounds of Monopoly with you and I had to play and give you every dime that I made and then for 50 years every time that I played, if you didn&#39;t like what I did you got to burn it.</p>

<p>Like they did in Tulsa, and like they did in Rosewood.</p>

<p>How can you win?</p>

<p>How can you win?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t win. The game is fixed. So when they say &quot;Why do you burn down the community? Why do you burn down your own neighborhood?&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not ours.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t own anything.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t own anything.</p>

<p>Trevor Noah said it so beautifully last night; &quot;There&#39;s a social contract that we all have, that if you steal or if I steal then the person, who is the authority, comes in and they fix the situation.</p>

<p>But the person who fixes the situation is killing us!</p>

<p>So the social contract is broken! And if the social contract is broken, why the fuck do I give a shit, about burning the fucking Football Hall of Fame, about burning the fucking target.</p>

<p>You broke the contract when you killed us in the streets and didn&#39;t give a FUCK.</p>

<p>You broke the contract rules for 400 years we played your game and built your wealth.</p>

<p>You broke the contract when we built our wealth again, on our own, by our bootstraps, in Tulsa and you dropped bombs on us. When we built it in Rosewood and you came in and you shot at us.</p>

<p>You broke the contract, so fuck your target. Fuck your Hall of Fame. Far as I&#39;m concerned, they could burn this bitch to the ground and it still wouldn&#39;t be enough and they are lucky that what black people are looking for is equality, and not revenge.</p>
