<p>I&#39;m trying to get him to watch the documentary &quot;13th&quot;, but he refuses and says he won&#39;t be subjected to &quot;liberal black-crime apologizing propaganda&quot; and &quot;if they really cared about black lives they&#39;d stop killing each other&quot;.

<p>He&#39;s exclusively a 24-hour Fox News kind of guy, and I mean EXCLUSIVELY. It concerns me that he gleans all of these attitudes and information from the biggest cable news channel in the country. He&#39;s an educated guy, he&#39;s a doctor, and a great one at that.

<p>When they do so, they must propose and defend a thesis that they are able and willing to participate in good faith, and that they regret the errors they made which led to the ban.</p>

<p>This space is valuable. Our time and efforts and skills as moderators are valuable. The mission of this subreddit is valuable.</p>

<p>Wasting our time / resources on purpose is bad faith engagement. Demanding labour from us which we are not volunteering to provide, is theft. Derailing and hijacking this subreddit is impermissible.</p>

<p>One -- just one -- of our moderator staff banned more than 300 users in the past 30 days. That alone is still less than 1% of all the moderation activity on this subreddit.
