        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>at about noon<br/>
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon<br/>
I gotta get drunk before the day begins<br/>
Before my mother starts bitching about my friends<br/>
About to go and damn near went blind<br/>
Young niggaz at the path throwing up gang signs<br/>
Ran in the house, and grabbed my clip<br/>
With the mack 10 on the side of my hip<br/>
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon<br/>
Just as I thought the fools kept stepping<br/>
Jumped in the fo&#39; hit the juice on my ride<br/>
I got front back and side to side<br/>
Then I let the alpine play (play)<br/>
Pumping new shit by N.W.A.<br/>
It was gangster gangster at the top of the list<br/>
Then I played my own shit and it went somethin&#39; like this<br/>
Cruising down the street in my six-fo&#39;<br/>
Joking the bitches, slapping the hoes<br/>
Went to the park to get the scoop<br/>
Knuckleheads out there cold, shooting some hoops<br/>
A car pulls up, who can it be?<br/>
A fresh El Camino rolling kilo G<br/>
He rolled down his window and he started to say<br/>
It&#39;s all about making that G.T.A.  </p>

<p><em>[Chorus:]</em><br/>
&#39;Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br/>
You come talking that trash, we&#39;ll pull ya card<br/>
Knowin&#39; nothing in life but to be legit&#39;<br/>
Don&#39;t quote me, boy, &#39;cause I ain&#39;t said shit  </p>

<p><em>[Scratches]</em> yo, man<br/>
&quot;Get the fuck out.&quot;<br/>
<em>[Scratches]</em> pump that beat<br/>
&quot;Motherfucker, say what.&quot;  </p>

<p>Down on Bs is the place to give me the pace<br/>
He said my man J.D. is on freebase<br/>
The boy J.D. was a friend of mine<br/>
&#39;Til I caught him in my car trying to steal the alpine<br/>
Chased him down the street to call a truce<br/>
The silly motherfucker pulls out a deuce deuce<br/>
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge<br/>
One sucker dead, L.A. times front page  </p>

<p><em>[Chorus:]</em><br/>
&#39;Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br/>
You come talking that trash, well, pull ya card<br/>
Knowin&#39; nothing in life but to be legit&#39;<br/>
Don&#39;t quote me boy &#39;cause I ain&#39;t said shit  </p>

<p><em>[Scratches]</em> &quot;Yo, Leroy.&quot;<br/>
<em>[Scratches]</em> &quot;Beer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue.&quot;  </p>

<p>Bored as hell and I wanna get ill<br/>
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill<br/>
The fellas out there making that dollar<br/>
I pulled up in my 6 fo&#39; Impala<br/>
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinking<br/>
And from the 8 ball, my breath starts stinking<br/>
Left to get my girl to rock that body<br/>
Before I left, I hit the Bacardi<br/>
Went to her house to get her out of the pad<br/>
Dumb hoe said something that made me mad<br/>
She said something that I couldn&#39;t believe<br/>
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave<br/>
She started talking shit, wouldn&#39;t you know<br/>
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the hoe<br/>
Her father jumped up and he started to shout<br/>
So I threw a right cross and knocked his old-ass out  </p>

<p><em>[Chorus:]</em><br/>
&#39;Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br/>
You come talking that trash, well, pull ya card<br/>
Knowin&#39; nothing in life but to be legit&#39;<br/>
Don&#39;t quote me boy &#39;cause I ain&#39;t said shit  </p>

<p><em>[Scratches]</em> &quot;Who do you think you are Mr. Big Stuff?&quot;<br/>
<em>[Scratches]</em> &quot;Rock this motherfucker like the hard 3 the hard way.&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m rolling hard, now under control<br/>
Then wrapped the 6 fo&#39; round a telephone pole<br/>
I looked at my car and I said, &quot;Oh, Brother.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;ll throw it in the gutter and go buy another<br/>
Walking home and I seen the G ride<br/>
Now cat is driving, kilo on the side<br/>
As they busted a u, they got pulled over<br/>
A undercover cop in a dark green nova<br/>
Cat got beat for resisting arrest<br/>
He socked a pig in the head for ripping his guess<br/>
Now G is caught, for doing the crime<br/>
Fourth offense on the boy, he&#39;ll do some time  </p>

<p><em>[Chorus:]</em><br/>
&#39;Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br/>
You come talking that trash, well, pull ya card<br/>
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit&#39;<br/>
Don&#39;t quote me boy &#39;cause I ain&#39;t said shit  </p>

<p><em>[Scratches]</em> L.A. player<br/>
<em>[Scratches]</em> big drum beater  </p>

<p>I went to get them out but there was no bail<br/>
The fellas caused a riot in the county jail<br/>
Two days later in municipal court<br/>
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart<br/>
&quot;Obstruction of the court,&quot; said the judge<br/>
On a six year sentence, my man didn&#39;t budge<br/>
Bailiff came over to turn him in<br/>
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin<br/>
He yelled out fire, then came Suzie<br/>
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi<br/>
Police shot the bitch but they didn&#39;t hurt her<br/>
Both upstate for attempted murder  </p>

<p><em>[Chorus:]</em><br/>
&#39;Cause the boys in the hood are always hard<br/>
You come talking that trash, well, pull ya card<br/>
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit&#39;<br/>
Don&#39;t quote me boy &#39;cause I ain&#39;t said shit  </p>

<p><em>[Scratches]</em><br/>
&quot;Yeah, I kicked a little ass,<br/>
But that was a blast from the past motherfucker.&quot;<br/>
<em>[Scratches]</em> &quot;Get busy ya ya ya ya&#39;ll.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I canâ€™t imagine being weak and useless enough to break a bone. People who break bones are the scum of the earth. If I was a doctor I wouldnâ€™t bother putting a cast on a broken bone, instead I would just kill the patient. How can someone who breaks a bone function in society, pathetic. A couple days ago a 4th grader asked me to sign his cast, I spat on him and pushed him to the ground. I canâ€™t be bothered with non milk drinkers. A cast is the mark of a bitch and a dysfunctional member of society</p>
