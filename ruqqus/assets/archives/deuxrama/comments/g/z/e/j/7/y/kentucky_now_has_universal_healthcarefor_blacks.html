    <div class="md"><p>I live in fentynal land and watched our Mr Rogers acting joke of a governor make that announcement live at his 4pm daily circlejerk. The guy opened a can of worms with his dumb comment and already had pissed off almost every fenthead in the state when he kept rattling on about how it was racism causing twice as many blacks to get the beer bug than whites. Totally wasn&#39;t that they had parties and didn&#39;t social distance. I could drive into any mid sized town and see the joggers all hanging out together on their stoops . The dude was literally voted in because our last governor was a loudmouthed idiot and people still almost reelected him because Kentucky is deeply a red state. We have what&#39;s called the Dixiecrat. Registered Democrats that hold extremely conservative values. So a lot thought bitchear was one too. His mask has slowly slipped off over time with his daily circlejerk live updates and now everyone is sick of him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every straight man wants to fuck another mans daughter, but no man actually wants his daughter to get fucked, its more something that men just accept because you have to expect to go through what your wife&#39;s father had to endure, if you plan on having children. There are however the rare cases of men who do what I referred to in my mind as &quot;Closing The Loop&quot;. Around that time when I was talking to my friends about this, about a week after the school scheduled for us to be given an inspirational speech by some rich white guy, basically all we heard were the same BS normie rhetoric which is just a denial of reality, you know like &quot;Just be yourself and work hard&quot;, statements that outright deny reality and the inherent advantages, genetic or otherwise, that differentiate everyone. One thing in particular that he said proved to me how lucky this guy was, he had multiple children and they were all boys, he said that he even kept trying to have a daughter but he only got sons, one of his sons even went on to become a millionaire. Seriously how fucking lucky is that, all I could think while sitting in that class, is that this lucky bastard closed the loop, without even trying. He got to fuck the shit out of the daughters of many men, but he will never be forced to live through the awkward phase of having to let an extension of yourself be sexually dominated by another man, he&#39;ll never have to face the awkwardly repulsive thoughts that a lot of fathers probably have to face, like the fact that in these times your daughter is likely going to be taking it in the ass, and will probably have all sought&#39;s of sick shit done to her. At the end of the day there are only two ways to close the loop, to only have sons by luck, or don&#39;t have any children at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t go for woke points in Kentucky trust me . Everyone is tired of bitchear&#39;s lecturing and he is literally the sole Democrat in the state legislation. He fucked up saying that today and me and everyone else is literally seething in fentynal land . He&#39;s accomplished his complete ostracization  today. None of the legislation 2ill work with him on any issue now.
