<p>Even a reading of a case on wikipedia(which is a pro-ADL narrative), Leo Frank was proven to be the last man to see the victim, Mary Phagan alive. Leo&#39;s defense involved the black janitor, Jim Conley, masterminded a complex plot in which he faked obviously flimsy evidence to implicate a black watchman in order to implicate Leo. Jim Conley&#39;s testimony that he was an accomplice involved in hiding the body after Leo murdered Mary was instead so convincing to the white jury that they convicted Leo. A black man&#39;s testimony was so convincing that a white jury took his word over that of white man&#39;s in Georgia in the early 20th century. But Leo had the power of several prominent Jewish figures in America that funded him heavily, during which the ADL was created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Twitch decided to create a &quot;safety council&quot;, made up of various people who are qualified to represent their community and to help advise them on policy changes. The council consists of various types, mostly those deep seated in the streaming and gaming communities, but also a few others qualified in relevant fields (such as one guy with a PHD in criminology and cyber bullying, and a professor of online sociology).</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s this person, who&#39;s only qualification to be on the council is that they are trans, and immediately after the announcement they became drunk with power and there are various clips on LivestreamFails of them proclaiming how they &quot;have power and nobody can take it away&quot; or how some people should &quot;definitely be afraid of me&quot;, while also making blanket statements about all gamers being white supremacists (a perfect specimen to represent a community made up mostly of gamers).

    <div class="md"><p>mate as i said this viewpoint is caused my misunderstanding of what dysphoria is...</p>

<p>Your link supports my argument.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we had a better understanding that this was not actually a mental health condition</p>

<p>A World Health Organization expert said it now understands transgender is &quot;not actually a mental health condition&quot;.</p>

<p>Governments should swiftly reform national medical systems and laws that require this now officially outdated diagnosis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>just linking what your &quot;proof&quot; said. The diagnosis was proven untrue and to help reduce the stigma trans people were getting because they are &quot;mentally ill, deluded people&quot; they removed it from the category immediately. The article never says that it was removed purely because of stigma whilst still remaining true.</p>

<p>Humans used to think homosexuality was a mental disorder. Do you think that was changed cause of &quot;stigma&quot; as well?</p>

<p>you can still read up on what dysphoria is. Its not something nearly all transgender people have and it is something that cis people can get. the cure to dysphoria is HRT and SRS</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool now post all the older psychiatric papers on the use of ice pick lobotomies praising it&#39;s use for literally every diagnosis ( and in a lot of cases misdiagnosed mental disorders) . See sweaty let me explain something to you. All this trans shit , and oh is it shit , is already being looked at that the same way as icepickers and other more extreme things done in the psychiatric community. See here&#39;s the thing a majority of &quot;transgenders&quot; are autistic which IS a mental disorder. It&#39;s been proven over and over. Also the fact that you stated that you don&#39;t have to have gender dysmorphia to be trans just goes to show exactly what a joke this fad of a movement has become. If for 1 second you can&#39;t see that the jerky autistic dude who thinks he&#39;s literally a woman but also a deer is mentally unwell then you might want to step out a little more and get away from such niche subreddits. The fact is that the trans movement is a fad that is actively recruiting young impressionable autistic and other easily swayed people to their movement . See there is a culture going on where if someone is labeled a &quot;phobic &#39; it ruins their career. Just like all the people who spoke out against the use of over medications of children , the ice pick lobotomy insanity , the literal imprisonment and sterilization of 1000s of those deemed mentally ill ( deaf people included ) the literal sexual abuse of depressed or excitable women and shock therapy. See they had their careers destroyed for speaking out and saying &quot; hey maybe we shouldn&#39;t be doing this&quot;  and going against the literal fad theories that were disproven. It took years and in some cases decades for all of these practices to be disproven and rejected. The trans thing already has many in the community speaking out and supporting each other when it comes to criticizing the latest fad practice . You can post all the papers and theories you want but the fact is that children and the childlike are being preyed on by others to convert them to their fad. See sweaty some people love being a victim. It allows them to have an excuse for their own shortcomings and place the blame on others for their failures. So keep doing your copy and paste of the studies that are the in thing now but do a remindme! In 5 years when the whole thing has flipped and now they say it needs therapy and not immediate HRT , You know like they required long term counseling and living as the sex they identified as before the doctors would even remotely consider doing such a drastic and potentially life destroying procedure.  You can call me a transphobe  or a bigot all you want but keep in mind bby : I don&#39;t hate them , I don&#39;t fear them,. I feel so fucking sorry for them that it is almost heartbreaking .</p>

</blockquote>

<p>so since it might be debunked later we shouldn&#39;t believe in it even though majority consensus is towards it being true? I see, ok.</p>

<p>your link literally means nothing?</p>

<p>yes it being a remarkable fight in todays culture makes it popular among young people. But these people go through a phase. Since they do not show any signs of having dysphoria they also physically cannot get HRT or SRS. That is only prescribed after a long process of psychiatric and medical evaluation. They literally make no permanent changes in their life. Its a phase like any other.</p>

<p>You could even argue it is a good one since it gets them to question gender identity and the roles we give to men and women in society.</p>

<p>Transgenderism is a new thing and not fully understood by anyone yet. But claiming it destroys lives or that its just a fad is just incorrect.</p>

<p>as your own link said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The historical and cross-cultural record indicates that conditions akin to what we now call &quot;transgender identity&quot; have been known to occur in all societies, with varying degrees of acceptance, suppression, or even encouragement. The widespread acceptance of individuals who were born males and dress and live as females, such as the hijra in India, katoey in Thailand, bakla in the Philippines, and travesti in Brazil, for example, long predates the current transgender movement in the West.  Despite a longstanding recognition of their existence, transgender individuals in those countries continue to face some discrimination. Among the Kuna (also known as Guna) of the San Blas Islands in Panama, transgender identity appears to have been fully accepted since precolonial times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shockingly this has happened quite a lot in history. Just now in current culture we are able to research and normalise it on a bigger scale</p>

    <div class="md"><p>alright so i think you should do some more research than an nypost article.</p>

<p>Puberty blockers are started when your puberty is starting. Typically that is around age 10-11.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For most children, puberty begins around ages 10 to 11, though some start earlier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is giving puberty blockers to 7 or 8 year olds.</p>

<p>here are some links related to puberty blockers</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phsa.ca/transcarebc/child-youth/affirmation-transition/medical-affirmation-transition/puberty-blockers-for-youth">http://www.phsa.ca/transcarebc/child-youth/affirmation-transition/medical-affirmation-transition/puberty-blockers-for-youth</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are under age 18, the criteria for getting a prescription for a puberty blocker are:</p>

<p>a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender non-conformity or gender dysphoria</p>

<p>gender dysphoria emerged or worsened with the onset of puberty
coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems, if any, are stable enough to start treatment</p>

<p>the adolescent having given informed consent, and the parents or guardians having given consent and being involved in supporting the adolescent throughout the treatment process</p>

<p>Puberty blockers are considered to be very safe overall.</p>

<p>Possible side effects of GnRH analogue treatment include:</p>

<p>Injection site swelling
Weight gain
Hot flashes
Headaches</p>

<p>We are not sure if puberty blockers have negative side effects on bone development and height. Research so far shows that the effects are minimal. However, we won’t know the long-term effects until the first people to take puberty-blockers get older.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and even after they start with puberty blockers they still can&#39;t just go and get &quot;peepeechopped&quot; or whatever you guys call it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While most children take the medication for a few years, every child is different. After suppressing puberty for a few years, your child might decide to stop hormone therapy or pursue other hormone treatments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while they are taking puberty blockers they are under constant study</p>

Go on and ignored my whole point of the 1000s of people being taken advantage of and why that&#39;s not good. As long as you feel that you got your heckin cute validation you can let the world burn around you. Like almost every troid youre a narcissist and it shows.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah ill link you what it says on mayoclinic. I linked this in my other reply aswell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the typical treatment time frame?</p>

<p>For most children, puberty begins around ages 10 to 11, though some start earlier.</p>

<p>What are the criteria for use of pubertal blockers?</p>

<p>To begin using pubertal blockers, a child must:</p>

<p>Show a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria</p>

<p>Have gender dysphoria that began or worsened at the start of puberty</p>

<p>Address any psychological, medical or social problems that could interfere with treatment</p>

<p>Provide informed consent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And even if some type of mistake happened which can happen of course</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are the changes permanent?</p>

<p>Use of GnRH analogues doesn&#39;t cause permanent changes in an adolescent&#39;s body. Instead, it pauses puberty, providing time to determine if a child&#39;s gender identity is long lasting. It also gives children and their families time to think about or plan for the psychological, medical, developmental, social and legal issues ahead.</p>

<p>If an adolescent child stops taking GnRH analogues, puberty will resume.</p>

<p>Astroturfing is the practice of masking the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants.</p>

<p>??????? i literally have linked medical clinics and have been using their arguments.</p>

<p>and yes usually sources are quite good. Anyone can tell people anything if they never have to prove what they are saying</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey troid weirdo . You&#39;re boring and you deflect like the autist you are. So go on and deny that they don&#39;t put children on hormone blockers . Go on and ignored my whole point of the 1000s of people being taken advantage of and why that&#39;s not good. As long as you feel that you got your heckin cute validation you can let the world burn around you. Like almost every troid youre a narcissist and it shows. So go on and feel that you won this when only in your deluded mind you did. Everyone who doesn&#39;t scan over your agenda posting copy and paste jobs and ignore you will all say that you just wouldn&#39;t accept reality . This is why the vast majority of people have turned against it all .</p>
