        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, I have never worked with female programmers before until recently. I had always been the only waman everywhere I went due to the century long conspiracy against women that had kept us out of STEM. </p>

<p>Just like on Reddit. I was always swimming through a sausagefest. It stinks and it‚Äôs filled with all kinds of -cels who can‚Äôt even have eye contact with me because they are too shy. Some male programmers, I don‚Äôt even know what they are yapping about because they turn into bumbling fools in front of any women.  </p>

<p>With all that said, I had full control over everything. Everyone used tabs indentation because that‚Äôs how I like it. Everyone followed my linting rules. This went way beyond coding. I also got to decide what to have for lunch every single day. When I worked late, some of them would stay behind to keep me company. In other words, I was the Queen bee üêù and I had full control over my male workers. </p>

<p>I got a job offer at a much larger company recently and that came with a lot of developers. So many that I can‚Äôt even remember most of them. I‚Äôm no longer the only waman anymore. I just felt the general distrust but I tried to think rationally and stayed open minded to working with other women. </p>

<p>This is how men have oppressed women for decades. By limiting the women‚Äôs interest in STEM and by showering the only waman around them with so much attention and general pushed over behavior that women are now scared to share their reign with other women. Thus, the Queen Bee Syndrome.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it‚Äôs all the men‚Äôs fault.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hit the gym bitch! - Now that you aren&#39;t the prettiest foid in the room by virtue of being the only foid in the room nobody has time to entertain your nonsense. Female privilege is reserved for the hot girls. Nobody (including beta-autists) wants some fat, hatchet-faced femcel, HardIsLife bossing them around when they could have a SexyCyborg gigastacy bossing them around. If you can&#39;t out-Stacy the Stacies you are doomed.</p></li>
<li><p>Migrate to a smaller <del>sub</del> company. Go back to being the <del>hottest</del> only foid in the company and reclaim your position over the thirstybois by being a big fish in a small pond in the same way you jumped from drama to deux. That way they&#39;ll have no choice but to lap up your tumblerina gussyposts just like we do because there is no other option.</p></li>
