        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bareballz told me to masterbate
Hardislife I do hate
0/10 I would rate
Never will she have a date</p>

<p>I wish I was 6
but fate and destiny are dicks
Maybe once I make it to heaven
ill stop being 5&#39;11</p>

<p>I wish I was six foot nine
But then it&#39;d be hard to sixty nine
With my gurl who is four foot nine</p>

<p>with great consternation, the nazis built a nation, sent the joos to the woods for a camp
the weather wasnt pleasing, the conditions uneasing
they died in the cold and the damp</p>

<p>Guero has dinero
More then you think
Then again you don’t think
Ain’t that right little twink?</p>

<p>twink he may be
but truth he does see
never met a responsible beaner
when daddy sends you packing
you&#39;ll be in for a shellacking
and GDOW will say neener neener</p>

<p>literary genius with a giant penis
my career took off to venis
but then it careened
they said I was obscene
and when I was cancelled
they all did a dance and 
they shouted dude she was ten!</p>

<p>Holy fuck lawl
Deuxchad poetry club
My mother in law
Gave me a good rub</p>

<p>yallre just jealous
of my perfection
yallre very gay
and rhyme good</p>

<p>Thots and tots
One makes another
While the other lacks a good mother</p>

<p>He likes anal
Why and how
His opinions are anal
His cars a Prius
And his jeans are skinny
His views are lefty
His height is so miny 
Buzzfeed he reads
At Zoomers he reees
At the end of the night
He’s back on his knees
Your probably asking
Wait how is he gay
He posts on plebbit
That’s all there is to say</p>

<p>Libtards, I own
My basement, I roam
Minorities I hate
Womans I rate
And the end of the day
My tendies await
And the scale itself
Goes back up in weight</p>

<p>Shapiro&#39;s the name
Logic&#39;s the game
Facts I shall frame
your brain I shall maim</p>

<p>Shapiro I am
I am Shapiro
Libtards I own
Epically as own
Redistribution of wealth
Put it back on the shelf
Unless it’s taxes and aid
To Israel you pay</p>

<p>ok I gotta go
time is short
if I stay any longer
my brain&#39;s gonna rot</p>

<p>I gotta go 
For the night I do call
The best part will be 
Getting to see you all
The morning it beckons
Neet life I desire
Wage slavery is suffering
But I need to be hired
My last desire
Is simply no fight
I need to say fuck it
And call it a night</p>

<p>Your 9-5
Feels like 1855
Slavery it is
The bills it will pay
Shitposting with deuxchat
I yearn for all day</p>

<p>I dont even work
I just show up and lurk
on plebbit all day I do post
tho I get paid
my ennui says hey
and this depression I cannot slay</p>

<p>Depression
A cure
What words could unferl it
Exercise and diet cure more then rope and a bullet</p>

<p>Put a smile on your face
Say fuck it oh well
At least I’m not dead yet and burning in hell
So today I look up
Feel free and swell
Grasp some fresh air and say oh well</p>

<p>Im not actually depressed
just rather repressed
Id rather kick a puppy than rope
but I know that wont help 
just send me to hell
cuz thats shits just one giant cope</p>

<p>Work harder then you post
Your job it means well
And your boss he’s a prick
But probably means well
Stop lurking on plebbit
Make work go on without anger
Until your promoted
And your boss is demoted
He looks with a grin
Full of anger and sin 
And hangs you a plaque
That you can stack
What does it say
What does it may
You let go of danger
The plaque it reads
“Thanks for the gold kind stranger”</p>
