    <div class="md"><p>Yep, no measures at all against guns in the US, unless you count the:</p>

<p>National Firearms Act of 1934</p>

<p>Federal Firearms Act of 1938</p>

<p>Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968</p>

<p>Gun Control Act of 1968</p>

<p>Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988</p>

<p>Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990</p>

<p>Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just the major legislation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s legislation, and federal at that. Which can be applied haphazardly and can be just as easily reversed in a future administration/congress. Are you going to include the all the legislation enacted and different campaigns to promote the availability and access to firearms? It cuts both ways. </p>

<p>You cannot even research the mental health/public safety vector of firearm usage in America using certain federal research grants despite the ability to do so over 20 years ago. Americans are so cucked on gun-control it&#39;s shameful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does it matter that it can be reversed in the future if it’s in force now? The same can be said of literally any law in existence. Presumably that doesn’t mean murder is likely to be legal soon, for example.</p>

<p>Also, I assume you’re not even an American, given you talk about “Americans” like you’re not one of us. In which case you should know that, if anything, federal legislation is the more consistently applied form (not that you’ve given any reason to believe it wouldn’t be beyond stating it as if it were obvious).</p>

<p>Nor did I say American gun laws were stringent compared to the rest of the world, or that no policies encourage firearm usage. I was only responding to the claim that the US takes no measures at all against guns, as claimed above, since that’s patently false.</p>

<p>Ok... there’s been plenty of studies on it anyway, as a simple Google search will show, since people are interested to know and therefore give funds themselves. So what’s the problem?</p>

<p>Uh, it&#39;s not immutable law? It&#39;s liable to be repealed? Doesn&#39;t sound like a safeguard or a measure if it&#39;s permanence is doubtful. </p>

<p>Sure, if you want to create some weird strawman in your head that you&#39;re ebin-owning a euro, go for it. </p>

<p>No one said you did. Same way as I never said I am yuro? lmao</p>

<p>All studies are not created equal; not in scope, size, hypothesis or how well they are carried out, further idk what your point is about google&#39;s search of other studies, mine still stands. Americans are so cucked over gun-control they will even introduce bills prohibiting it&#39;s study using federal funds.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s cucked. </p>

<p>Pretend the &#39;libs&#39; are the problem all you want but it makes you sound uneducated. This is retarded horseshit which would be suited in previous century or different country, the real problem is the politicization of science and data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know no law is “permanent” right? Idk what you learned in civics class, but any law can be repealed by an act of Congress, so it’s not really valid that gun control laws are any more insecure in the face of repealment than any other law, since any law is equally easy/hard to get rid of.</p>

<p>Your original post basically acted like all the acts I listed were somehow “not enough,” and so my point was that I wasn’t contending they were “enough,” per se, just pointing out that they existed, which the person above me seemed to be denying. That’s all.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you don’t want to be mistaken for a European, maybe try learning literally anything about how the US legislature works and not being such a condescending prick</p>
