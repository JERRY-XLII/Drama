    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but this is too retarded for me. Usually I can laugh about people getting their panties in a twist, particularly if they envison themselves as some sort of heroic figures fighting the good fight against the shadow rulers of the world.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Here I don&#39;t even get what they bitch about. *The government can shut down schools!?* Yeah, but so can teachers if they don&#39;t show up.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>*Public services aren&#39;t really public because it&#39;s not an anarchistic short-lived free for all!?* Imagine not even being allowed to land your Blimp at La Guaria without notice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The criticism is mainly with his closing statement; “this is what makes America great.” I don’t know you mate, but when I think about what I love about America, it isn’t a few massive ponzi schemes (that will be insolvent in 15 years and 7 years, respectively), pathetic roads and bridges that take years to fix, a police force that kills 1,000 civilians a year (many of which for committing victimless crimes), and lastly flint Michigan is pretty good reason why govt. shouldn’t even be trusted for water sanitation. Our government is shit and NOT what we should be proud of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, do you by chance suffer from any cognitive disability (mayosim aside, that&#39;s obvious) or are you just a teenager?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what I love about America</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that&#39;s your problem right there!</p>

<p>Also, are you conviniently overlooking these highly upvoted hot takes, or are you just in agreement with them?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The shutdown including the parks was an egregious power move that was designed to explicitly show us that they are not public land at all and have been appropriated by people that consider themselves a ruling class.</em></p>

<p><em>Nothing is public. That’s what people don’t get. If the government wants to, they can shit down schools, court houses, whatever they want. And guess what? They can’t really be held accountable. Now picture that but with your medical insurance, home, and food. That’s communism. Communism is the goal of socialism and socialism is the goal of democratic socialism (even though they’re the same thing, I’ll humor the leftists).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the way, if the Central Park had been privatized it wouldn&#39;t be Central Park it would be Central Manhattan by now. And privatization of police forces is a great idea, already worked out stupendously for US prisons and overseas military forces. So privatizing Cops and judges is a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Maybe if you can get someone to explain to you what that <em>**e pluribus unum</em>* motto means, you&#39;ll have an epiphany and figure out why the US of A is such a shithole country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said I endorse every view expressed? I sure as hell didn’t and would recommend you don’t create straw men to attack. Pay attention to what I said, not some other comments. Great and how exactly can you say that about Central Park? What evidence do you have or is that more statist speculative nonsense? I don’t know what you hate about the US, but I probably hate it too.</p>
