        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a backend software engineer with 9 years of experience.</p>

<p>I am also very active in the events / meetups scene of my city (a European capital), to give some context.
Anyway, I have been approached 3 times this year to talk at the office of very prominent companies 💅🏼</p>

<p>The first time, it was for a Big 4 company. Women in tech event panel. I was very flattered they asked my insight as an engineer and that they would want to share my story. Good experience overall.</p>

<p>The second time, it was a couple of months later, from a recruiter on LinkedIn, and the company is a big tech scale up but less prominent than the first one.
The recruiter, also a woman, asked me if I wanted to talk at a Women in Tech event. I was very excited, and based on the vague info she provided me, I was happy to confirm I had a technical topic I was already preparing for other occasions.</p>

<p>She said ok thanks I will let you know. A month later, I asked her if there was an update and she told me that the event was postponed because of some issues. 🤔</p>

<p>Another month passed, and with surprise I see that she posted on LinkedIn a promotion of a Women in Tech event about to happen at her company and, surprise surprise! It&#39;s another panel, once again featuring few of the female employees. Not engineers. The thing that bothered me the most is that in her communication with me she didn&#39;t have the courtesy to tell me that the event was about soft skills and happening soon. I forgot about it and simply thought she was unprofessional.</p>

<p>Then another month passed. Another recruiter contacted me about a job position for a top 10 tech company. 💅🏼 </p>

<p>It was very flattering but I was still quite happy with my current job so I declined. The she asked me if I was interested in joining a Women in Tech event that her company was organizing. I was still naive at that time and yes, once again I didn&#39;t see it coming. I proposed the same tech topic I proposed in the past. </p>

<p>I confirmed my interest before the event was actually set in stone, to figure out on a later stage that, alas, it was another soft skills panel. They knew that I proposed a technical topic and they dodged the point until I was actually too involved in the conversation to pull back. But I know I started seeing a pattern.</p>

<p>So the event happened. 5 panelists including me. 1 engineer (me), 1 entrepreneur with a background of programming, 1 data scientist, 1 designer and 1 product owner. The last 2 really just worked for a tech company, they didn&#39;t have any background in tech. 2 out of 5 worked for the event hosting company, and when asked about insights and tips, were most times talking about the diversity initiatives existing in the company. It was very embarrassing.</p>

<p>Last but not least. There is a very big Women in Tech conference coming soon in my city that will last 2 days. 99% of the talks are about soft skills. Almost zero tech talks. Even the workshops!!</p>

<p>I feel insulted, infuriated and sad. 😑 For me, but also for all the brilliant engineers and women in tech that get approached for women in tech events only to be confined to soft skills topics 🙄 and they don&#39;t get to talk about their actual job and tech knowledge! 😡 I have experience in public talks related to very technical topics, btw.</p>

<p>It seems like that right now it&#39;s very hard to make a simple step further and I feel very upset by this trend.
Let me clarify: refining soft skills and talking about diversity and inclusion is extremely important. And we should absolutely keep talking about it. But that shouldn&#39;t be the main mean to give support to women in tech. I&#39;m not a tool you can use to recruit women.</p>

<p>End of the rant.</p>
