    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Sung-Miller said she was in the process of moving to a different dorm room and on the phone with her parents, Ellen Sung and David Miller, just before the alleged attack began.</p>

<p>“She screamed with the most terrifying scream I’ve ever heard from anybody else outside of a horror movie,” Miller said. “And then what I heard was either ‘You’re assaulting me’ or ‘Stop assaulting me.’”</p>

<p>Sung-Miller said her former roommate damaged and threw some of her property at her including a packed suitcase, leaving her with 15 to 20 bruises and a fractured finger.</p>

<p>She said she called 911 during the alleged attack after getting disconnected from her parents. Residential Life staff and the police arrived shortly after to mediate the situation, Sung-Miller said.</p>

<p>She said her relationship with her former roommate initially deteriorated prior to the attack because her roommate was insensitive of Sung-Miller’s constant migraines.</p>

<p>Their problems escalated when Sung-Miller learned from the former roommate that her roommate’s father allegedly sexually abused her roommate and her younger sister, she said. Sung-Miller said she related this information to Sung and Miller, who called child protective services.</p>

<p>After child protective services arrived at the former’s roommate’s family home, the former roommate became upset and later asked Sung-Miller for an apology right before the alleged attack, Sung-Miller said.</p>

<p>Sung-Miller did not answer because she was previously told by residential director Alysa Cook to cease contact with her former roommate, Sung-Miller said.</p>

<p>“Because the RD had told me not to interact with her I just kept my mouth shut … and didn’t look at her and kept trying to call my sister,” Sung-Miller said. “Then finally because she kept getting angrier and angrier I called my parents back.”</p>

<p>A different series of events is described in partially redacted, internal incident reports from the dean of students that were obtained by the Bruin.</p>

<p>Their resident assistant was told by the former roommate that Sung-Miller called the police during an argument and falsely reported an attack to incriminate her, according to one incident report.</p>

<p>The former roommate also told UCPD detective Justin Bell that Sung-Miller’s father harassed the roommate’s mother and planned to make false police reports to force her to move out of the dorm room she shared with Sung-Miller, according to an incident summary submitted to the UCLA Dean of Students by detective Bell.</p>

<p>Sung said she called child protective services because Sung is mandated to report abuse as a physician. Miller denies harassing the former roommate’s family and said he never contacted the family.</p>

<p>The former roommate admitted to detective Bell that she crushed a pine cone and tore up paper lanterns belonging to Sung-Miller in the course of the argument, but also alleges Sung-Miller grabbed her wrist and punched her chin, according to the incident summary from Bell.</p>

<p>“I never tried clocking her or punching her or anything,” Sung-Miller said. “When she was tearing apart my belongings, I did try to hold her wrist by the coat to try and keep her from tearing them apart.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems at least one of them is being very dishonest.</p>
