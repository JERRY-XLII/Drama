        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m trans myself. When I first came out, I sought out trans groups on facebook to find support, others like me, that kinda thing. At first it was really cool knowing I&#39;m not alone, even had common interests with some and befriended them. That&#39;s where problems started. These people are the most angry, callous, aggressive people ever. It wasn&#39;t long before the language of all my friends got policed, and I&#39;d get messages with screenshots and the like, saying &quot;your friend did this, why are you friends with someone like that?&quot; and not wanting to lose the only connection to others like myself, I&#39;d cut off that friend. Next thing I know, pretty much none of my old friends are around anymore, I just know these &quot;leftbooker&quot; trans people, who are nonstop sharing articles of dead trans women or screaming about how some crossdressing anime boy is actually a trans woman or some other shit. So much infighting, doxxing each other, calling each other names, telling people to shut up and die based on their gender, cisness, race, it was hell. I distanced myself from the groups and got some backlash telling me to kill myself over it. But I managed to preservers and then like, start actually engaging in my hobbies. For about a year my entire being was just trans trans trans. It was fresh and new and I wanted to get it off my chest. But then once I got used to it, I wanted to just continue being me, just different gender. That...didn&#39;t go well. Every single hobby I have is somehow problematic and these people will not shut up. They don&#39;t have a concept of just leaving something you disagree with be, no! Everything must be called out angrily! Long paragraphs dissecting every aspect, reaching in any possible way to find ways in which things I love are actually out to get me. Combined with the constant influx of dead trans people articles, telling me nobody but these other trans people will ever see me as a human being, really messed with my self-esteem. And to make matters worse, I&#39;m constantly being sexually harassed by trans women. I was born a girl, but I&#39;m a boy. They call themselves trans lesbians and keep inboxing me to say how horny they are, or show me their girldick. I hate it!!! I don&#39;t want to see dick! But that&#39;s being transphobic. Everything is transphobic. Everything out to get me, but most of all? The other trans people. I fucking hate these freaks now. All of them are constantly out to fuck each other and anyone that says hi to them, always making moves but you can&#39;t say anything because oh no that makes you a terf because terfs say trans women are predators!!! Why is not a single one of them fucking normal? All of them are just fucking weird. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re hated for being trans, I don&#39;t get any of that even from rightwingers. I think they&#39;re hated for being fucking loud, obnoxious weirdos that have mental breakdowns all the damn time in peoples faces. I&#39;m sick of them all and regret ever coming in contact with them. If you&#39;re baby trans, just don&#39;t go anywhere near these people. They&#39;re unbalanced and everything they do just feeds into it. They celebrate being angry, calling it revolutionary, like being an aggressive asshole is somehow something difficult. I&#39;m a really gentle and nonconfrontational person and they walk all over me and treat me like utter shit while hiding behind their identity and belittling others for what they were born as. And as time goes on, I realize more that these people don&#39;t even like me as a person. They collected me for my identity. To be part of their personal online army, to tag me in their big online drama to back them up, that kinda shit. And maybe to make fake outraged statuses about me when I finally fucking kill myself from the way they make me feel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s because a lot of trans people should never have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. A disproportionate amount of transgender people are bitter angry lesbians who spend most of their time on Reddit and tumblr, and statistics show that a good few trans people don’t feel any more satisfied after transitioning. I’m in full support of transgender people, and do believe it is a real mental illness that should be treated with transitioning, but I also think that when you’re depressed and hate your body your gonna look for a reason other than that you spend all your time on reddit and don’t take care of yourself. For some people the conclusion they come to is gender dysphoria, and then when they unnecessarily transition and don’t feel any better they return to their self destructive ways on reddit and tumblr and complain about how society is their problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that this is pasta but I unironically agree.</p>

<p>I just want to make edgy jokes, call people retarded and live a normal life irl but the ‘you must be an angel to everyone all the time even if it’s mutual banter or just an argument’ mentality pervades literally every trans subreddit, but worse is the hyper-left bias in any of them over 25k. Think that it’s a good thing that police exist to catch criminals? Dogpiled. Think that starting and running a business is a right of people? Dogpiled. Etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it as a lever being used to make us emasculated little liars to ashamed to denounce the propaganda and fall further and further from any chance of fixing our shit.</p>

<p>Communist propaganda frequently had blatant lies everyone knew they were lying it was so obvious even the government knew it was obvious many times, they would lie about unimportant things just to see who was foolish enough to openly contradict the state, &quot;what the state says is always true, even if it isn&#39;t, contradicting the state is a crime.&quot; essentially it was bait to destroy dissenters a first but then they realized it massively demoralized everyone else and cowed them into submission, not solely because they were continually confronted by their own cowardice but also it emasculated them because they were participating in the lies, if you ever rejected the state&#39;s deceits you had already been forced to parrot these ideas for so long that you were  admitting that you were a scummy little liar either way, you had no morals, why should anyone follow you.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what sexual perversion being given for free to the masses is about today, free porn and long term porn addiction causes novelty decay and forces porn addicts to find more novel porn, Trans porn weird hentai, child porn, foot porn, those are all the first steps of porn addiction search for more novel and taboo porn, tier two is gay porn, scat/vomit, ugly trans porn, interracial cuck porn, snuff and gore. The sooner this happens to a person the more confused about their own sexuality they will be if they ever try to live a moral life and reform society you can bet your bottom dollar their porn history will be made public to discredit them. most people who try to fix society know they are past saving anyway so it becomes a scenario where you have these sex addicted congressmen fucking dudes in bathrooms while trying to restrict all of the things that led them down that path so that another generation doesn&#39;t fall into the same pit.</p>

<p>Subversion is their tool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Human ingenuity&quot;</p>

<p>Boy do I have some ideology you might want to try on.</p>

<p>This is a long story so I&#39;ll be painfully concise. Ideology I&#39;ve been painting on thick across the web for years was practically copy pasted into the El Paso shooter&#39;s manifesto; UBI/entitlements in the face of the new automation revolution and demographic displacement being at the heart of economic unsustainability and ultimately intense civil conflict or a dystopic shit hole being the outcomes.</p>

<p>So I considered what non violent means can we use to meet similar goals, the classic of non violent resistance is refusing to give taxes to the corrupt state, but the state isn&#39;t the only corrupt entity, corporations are also our enemy, and obviously we aren&#39;t going to co-ordinate mass civil disobedience with the cucks who believe they must always render unto &quot;Caesar&quot; what is &quot;Caeser&#39;s&quot;.</p>

<p>Become ungovernable by way of forcing the state and corporations to over spend with acts of non violent time delayed mischief that are functionally anonymous. consider the second amendment, this is a porcupine&#39;s defense, it pricks it&#39;s attacker and repels much larger foes, but a Skunk has a similar predator defense which makes the predator flee by disgusting them, it can even be used against non predators, becoming ungovernable is about ruining the resources your enemy is reliant upon and thereby sowing discords, infighting and internal conflict.</p>

<p>There are plants which could be planted into government housing areas, in the grassy bushy area between two businesses where their parking lots meet, and hidden on the land of the wealthy merely by tossing out seed and rhizome, more mischievous even would be planting some of these plants which indirectly or in association could harm humans along roadsides. Plant&#39;s which poison on contact with skin, plants which devalue property by their invasive and destructive nature, plants which act as nests for hordes of skin burrowing insects, plants which are poisonous if ingested but resemble edible plants, plants which have destructive roots that can damage a buildings foundation and tear up roads and sidewalks. I wont name these plants now but they do exist.</p>

<p>Make the government waste the taxes of millions on repairs with untraceable culprits, security systems can&#39;t see me throw a few seeds or a carved rhizome pushed into the ground via my boot heel, they wont think to track and ID me, the damage wont even be done until many days later and the only recourse is full excavation in the case of our heavy hitter.</p>

<p>Why kill 20 and do millions in damages at the cost of your own life, when you could kill no-one and do billions in damages leading to real fiscal problems that cause others to commit violence in frustration.</p>

<p>Pro tip: eco-terrorism isn&#39;t covered in most businesses insurance policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to believe people are who they say they are so I give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to posts like these.</p>

<p>I can understand some frustration with online trans communities. A lot of them I’ve been part of are pretty depressing and it took me a long time to find one that managed to separate regular chat or posts from venting ones. Often unmoderated ones will devolve into constant venting and depressing or suicidal rants which isn’t what a lot of trans people need in terms of support.</p>

<p>However I can’t help but believe a lot of this persons post is exaggerated. I highly doubt tons of trans women are sending this guy dick pics unless he’s going into some explicitly NSFW channels, which do exist. I can believe it may have happened once, some random idiot sent me one because he was trying to hit on me one time, but a ton of them, from trans people, never. Also the constant “all trans people are literal freaks” is something I never hear from even the disgruntled trans people I know. Heck, I don’t think even Blair White would make such a broad statement.</p>

<p>Of course this person could have fallen into some dark trans space online and not the ones I’ve been part of, which are nothing like this. Again, I like to give the benefit of the doubt but random accounts created to pretend to be a minority to bash them are not uncommon at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back when I was a liberal teenager I hung out on 420chan and did observe their trans community for some time and It&#39;s obvious that they are unwell but back then they didn&#39;t seem so aggressively unwell and outwardly destructive, I haven&#39;t checked in on them in years, I imagine it&#39;s similar to how the Copypasta described reddit and facebook communities, but even though I&#39;m what internet activists would call a &quot;nazi&quot; these days I still have sympathy for  the mentally ill but am simultaneously enraged over the intentional confusion and abuse of mostly young men, being fooled into ruining their endocrine systems by porn addiction and those miserable bastards who want them to suffer and want company in their suffering.</p>
