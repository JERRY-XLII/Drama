        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2019-08-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/HardIsLife.html">HardIsLife</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It‚Äôs not Steven Crowder or Milo his last name too hard to spell or Bearing or Sargon or the like that turned me into an anti SJW for a minute back in 2016.</p>

<p>So, here I was a perfectly SJW extremist. I was very active in the LGBTQIAA+ community and I watched + agreed with TYT. Therefore, all my YouTube recommendations were similar to that political spectrum. I was in the bubble and I also watched John Oliver on HBO. I knew from Community and everything. One day he did a segment about how women are bullied more online and I was like ‚Äúhell, yeah, about time!‚Äù The main example he gave Anita another last name that is hard to spell. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PuNIwYsz7PI">https://youtu.be/PuNIwYsz7PI</a></p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know about her at all. Never heard of her but that video had a more significant dislikes than others so I read the comments. People were namedroping the amazing atheist, thunderf00t, Sargon of Akkad, etc. So, I very briefly looked up a few videos of them talking about Anita. Some good points were made, that I admitted. And I went back to Jezebel to talk about it and suddenly, despite my long history of being there, I got reported as a troll. All I did was ask some questions about if there‚Äôs any legitimacy to what these youtubers were saying. I didn‚Äôt even say I agreed with them or anything because at that point, I didn‚Äôt even know what to believe. I also came clean by saying that I had very little knowledge about this and that I wanted to hear what this side would say to debunk. But instead I was reported by mass and blocked. </p>

<p>That really disturbed me and made me want to hear what the anti SJW crowed had to say. At first, I was very disturbed to hear such blunt statement from the likes like Milo but over time I got addicted to the drama and stayed for the drama. I also warned burgercels that Trump might win but they didn‚Äôt listen.</p>

<p>We can blame pepe memes and Russian bots all day long but those never attracted me until I got piled on by my own people. Basically, I got Aziz Ansari‚Äôed.</p>

<p>Now I‚Äôm neutralized and I‚Äôm all very radically centrist with communist tendencies but that‚Äôs ok ü§óI‚Äôm still pro LGBT, anti religion and I believe that white privileged exists. And I won‚Äôt use <a href="/r/drama">/r/drama</a> as long as it‚Äôs infected with right wingers üíÖüèº</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Would your bed be more comfortable if your pillow was shaped like a basketball? Or is that racist?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Turns out my hair stylist was being sarcastic about my turtleneck the other day. It&#39;s so hard to tell with those gay accents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anthropology? Why study my ancient ancestors when we can just study the primitive races like Eskimos or Italians.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I used to play a game called British or Gay? but it turns out that most of the British ARE gay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t blame them. If my people&#39;s women looked like that then I&#39;d ask them to cover their faces.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A woman president?! If I wanted to be led by a woman I&#39;d join a beehive!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m colorblind when it comes to races! I can&#39;t even tell if our brown mailman is puerto rican or armenian or an indian chief or something!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you interpreted what I said in a different way. I didn‚Äôt change my views because they upset me. I was finally willing to listen to the other side of the argument because of it. Before that I either shut out opposing views or was too sensitive to listen to them. I became much more tolerant to opposing views and gradually got better at arguing logically instead of emotionally because that incident made me reflect on how I had been acting too. </p>

<p>Like I said, I didn‚Äôt become anti LGBT or pro religion or anything like that. I still highly disagree with those who say there‚Äôs no such thing as white privilege. I just learned to listen with my brain and not with my emotions.</p>

<p>We wanted Trump to win.  The SJW crowd was becoming obnoxious enough to warrant it.  The mainstream left has doubled down and all the Democrats in the primary are even worse than in 2016.  He will probably win again.</p>
