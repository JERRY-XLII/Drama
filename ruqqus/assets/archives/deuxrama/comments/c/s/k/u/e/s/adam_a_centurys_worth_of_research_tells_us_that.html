The title of this post is nonsense, btw. Obviously genetics are important, but so are environmental factors.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m obviously more than familiar with this topic. You could have saved yourself a lot of embarrassment by reading through the comments I&#39;ve made in this thread so far. I trust they will be pretty enlightening for you. It is entirely uncontroversial that intelligence is influenced significantly by both environment and genetics, and I&#39;ve shown quite a few reasons why.  </p>

<p>First off, heritability of IQ has not been established &quot;firmly&quot; at 80%. The usual number you will find in scientific literature is 50-70%, with some results lower than that, some higher. It&#39;s also generally accepted that heritability is below 50% up to young adulthood.<br/>
You&#39;ve been talking about twin studies, yet the graph you&#39;ve posted mostly mentions adoption studies, a completely different thing. Concerning the proportion of the variability due to shared environment in 16-20 year olds (e.g. roughly where it drops off in adoption studies) twin studies put it at 30%. You can find this reviewed here: <em><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-17527-001">The effects of shared environment on adult intelligence: A critical review of adoption, twin, and MZA studies</a>.</em><br/>
It&#39;s not surprising to me that you don&#39;t know about these results, since if your picture is any evidence, you seem to get your information from a blog by someone who&#39;s not a scientist and clearly trying to push an agenda on an uneducated audience.<br/>
If you want to form an opinion on a scientific topic, you should get your information from respected, peer-reviewed publications, not random blogs. It&#39;s hard for laymen to interpret data correctly, know which data is available, or notice when someone is being disingenuous.</p>

<p>Concerning heritability estimates: These do <em>not</em> mean that this is the relative influence of genes on intelligence, they describe the proportion of observed variability that can be explained by genetic variation. This is important, since for example adoption studies create a rather specific environmental context for adopted children, i.e. parents adopting children are older, better educated and wealthier than average. These environmental factors, which (provably) all increase IQ, are the same and therefore won&#39;t create variability and won&#39;t show up in the proportions of variability (obviously). But they still exist! Here&#39;s a proper explanation of heritability and common public miconceptions about the concept: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wcs.1400"><em>The heritability fallacy</em></a></p>

<p>Lastly, while heritability of IQ is firmly established as 50-70%, this does not mean that this percentage is environment independent! We can only explain 5% of this variation with common genetic polymorphisms (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/node/56158.abstract"><em>GWAS meta-analysis (N=279,930) identifies new genes and functional links to intelligence</em></a>), where the rest of this heritability comes from, we aren&#39;t so sure. What we are sure about is that environment and genetics are inextricably linked: Genetics shape the environment, and the environment shapes genetics. For example, the missing heritability is linked to epigenetics (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-018-0222-7"><em>Epigenetic variance in dopamine D2 receptor: a marker of IQ malleability?</em></a>), which is influenced by the environment, and to genetic amplification through selected environments, i.e. genetic predispositions lead to the selection of specific environmental conditions, which then in turn influence intelligence (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23818655?dopt=Abstract&amp;amp;holding=npg"><em>Explaining the increasing heritability of cognitive ability across development: a meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies.</em></a>)</p>

<p>Thus, your simplistic claim that environmental factors are of &quot;minimal importance&quot; is wrong, even if you arbitrarily constrain environmental influences to a vague &quot;for us&quot;.</p>

<p>McGue et al.

They  and  other  authors  interpretedthese  numbers  as  being  supportive  of  the  results  from  adoptionstudies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oops. Looks like you are trying desparately to pick at straws here. The evidence is clear, shared environment has no effect in adulthood, the stage of life everyone actually cares about. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This actually pretty funny given how you <em>just tried to mislead me and anyone reading this</em>. Unfortunately for you, I have database access to these articles and can actually see how you&#39;re trying to spin things falsely and distort research findings. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>False, there is not evidence that they increase IQ permanently. Just that they <em>might</em> increase IQ <em>temporarily</em>. Stop lying and trying to spin things, please. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Environment is important, but without the right genetics a person will never, ever increase their IQ. the research is VERY clear here - despite BILLIONS of dollars on failed projects like Head Start and other failed commercial ventures (e.g. Lumosity) we are no closer to increasing IQ. The only paths forward that seem to increase IQ is genetic engineering through embyro selection or CRISPR. So you&#39;re points about the environment are moot - it doesn&#39;t really matter, our society is rich enough that we can provide a good enough environment. Theres also a lot of evidence that IQ is decreasing currently, and this can only be explained by dysgenic effects. So despite all of our enrichment and social programming, we are going in the opposite direction we need to be, and its down to genetics.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Oh really? How about we actually look at what the authors say:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t what the authors are saying at all, it&#39;s a quote of a paper they are discussing in that review. If you&#39;d actually read on, you&#39;d have found this part:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, the evidence from twin studies does not support the
evidence from adoption studies; it contradicts it. As we have seen,
the three adoption studies involving participants beyond childhood
are studies primarily involving late adolescents. (The average age
of adoptees in the second phase of Loehlin et al.’s, 1997, Texas
study is 18 years. The average age of participants in Scarr &amp;
Weinberg’s, 1978, study is 18 1 ⁄ 2 years. Participants in Teasdale &amp;
Owen’s, 1984, study are Danish men reporting to their draft board
at the age of 18 years or shortly thereafter. There has never been
an adoption study primarily involving adults over the age of 20
years.)
Thus, the appropriate comparison is not between the adoption
studies and the studies of adult twins. It is between the adoption
studies and the studies of twins between the ages of 16 years and
20 years.
For twins in that age group, the estimated proportion of vari-
ability due to the shared environment is around 30%. This contra-
dicts the results of the adoption studies for participants in that age
range, which indicate little or no effect for the shared environment.
The only way to interpret the evidence from adoption and twin
studies as being mutually supportive is to be careless about the
definition of the word adult.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And further:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, there are at least two major problems with McGue et al.’s
(1993) conclusion that studies of adult twins indicate little or no
effect of the shared environment on adult intelligence. One prob-
lem is that they made a questionable statistical adjustment in order
to deal with a negative estimate of a quantity that cannot be
negative. The other problem is that their conclusion requires
grouping together adults of all ages, but if young and middle-aged
adults are treated as a separate group from the elderly, the results
look very different. For young and middle-aged adults, the esti-
mated effects of the shared environment are slightly greater than
are those of the unshared environment. For the elderly, the esti-
mated effects of the shared environment are negative, a result that
is impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really didn&#39;t distort anything, that&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what I said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>False, there is not evidence that they increase IQ permanently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very obviously wrong. Nutrition, wealth, parent education, etc are all major factors in intelligence, from infancy onward. This isn&#39;t debatable in any way, it&#39;s well established science. You can literally put this into google and find hundreds of publications. Here, I picked one for you, which concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3270016/">The notion that heritability may be lower in lower-SES families is appealing, in part because of its environmental implications: If heritability is lower in lower-SES families, it suggests that environmental interventions might be more effective in boosting cognitive development for children in lower-SES families. The present study, which is based on a large UK-representative sample of children followed longitudinally, leads to a similar implication. Although the genetic influence on IQ is the same in lower-SES families, shared environmental influence appears to be greater in lower-SES families, suggesting that family-based environmental interventions might be more effective in these families. However, two further aspects of the results temper the policy implications of this finding. First, shared environmental influence is found in both lower- and higher-SES families and the difference in shared environmental influence between them is modest. Second, shared environmental influences on IQ decline from childhood to adulthood so that these influences might not have an impact in the long run.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which nicely leads us to your last point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Environment is important, but without the right genetics a person will never, ever increase their IQ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is absurdly wrong. Increase IQ with respect to which baseline? <em>Obviously</em> you can increase IQ by improving the environment, this is completely uncontroversial, the paper cited mentions environmental interventions too. If you want your child to have higher IQ, you should be wealthy, educated and feed a proper diet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only paths forward that seem to increase IQ is genetic engineering through embyro selection or CRISPR.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is complete and utter nonsense. First off, as I&#39;ve explained before, we can only pinpoint polymorphisms explaining roughly 5% of the variance, secondly, genetically modifying literally thousands of genes is impossible, and will be for a <em>long</em> time. You know what seems much more feasible to me? Improving environmental conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>our society is rich enough that we can provide a good enough environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is... obviously wrong again. SES is incredibly unequal in pretty much all societies. And how do you define &quot;good enough&quot;? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theres also a lot of evidence that IQ is decreasing currently, and this can only be explained by dysgenic effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does that make sense to you? How can a rise in 5-25 IQ points over one generation be reasonably explained by genetic changes? And how could a drop afterwards? Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s more likely that the drastic changes of everyday life are responsible? These guys seem to think so:<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/26/6674">Flynn effect and its reversal are both environmentally caused</a></em>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I have no idea why you are trying to argue with me. You&#39;re clearly not educated in this topic. I&#39;ve given you a lot of facts, you should try to understand them, maybe read through the papers I linked a bit and then rethink your opinions. Currently, you&#39;re denying scientific facts because you don&#39;t like them, but facts really don&#39;t care about your feelings.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about here, in regards to the Flynn effect.</p>

<p>First of all, it&#39;s not 25 points in 1 generation--it&#39;s 3 points per decade at the highest. The higher numbers are just not reliable.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s very important <em>where</em> these gains are. They&#39;re almost exclusively on the lower end of the spectrum.  We&#39;re talking about a bunch of people moving from scoring borderline retarded to scoring somewhat borderline retarded. Also, many of the studies are on CHILDREN&#39;s IQ scores, which are mainly dependent on emotional state and motivation rather than general intelligence.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the fact that these increases in scores are not even necessarily even increases to intelligence, but rather increases to the ability to take an IQ test (familiarity with tests, ability to direct attention, emotional state, motivation, etc).  </p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And since you mentioned it: We can be reasonably sure that the black-white IQ gap is not due to genetic differences. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh. &quot;We&quot; can? Funny how you don&#39;t give any explanation. It&#39;s almost as if you are just talking out of your ass.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s put IQ on hold for a second, and focus on a few other differences between blacks and whites.</p>

<p>First, explosive power. Blacks are faster than whites. Better sprinters, jumpers, etc. <strong>Out of the top 200 Olympic sprinters ever, zero are white.</strong> Zero. Blacks have significantly more fast twitch muscle fiber than whites. But hey, I imagine, all of this is just somehow magically environment, right? Except that it&#39;s finally being tracked down to genes--blacks in general have 4 times the ratio of the R vs X ACTN3 alleles, compared to whites (an important gene in muscle composition). </p>

<p>So let&#39;s talk about environment--first, the environment blacks evolved in. </p>

<p>Even a cursory understanding of evolution would tell you that an environment where you have like a 10% annual chance of dying to malaria, would favor a much higher time preference than places without malaria. And guess what? Blacks have an incredibly high time preference compared to other races, even other races in extremely deprived countries.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s racist, so let&#39;s just look at the sickle cell allele instead. 40% of people in Equatorial Africa carry it. It sentences 1/4th of your children to death, leaves 1/4th unaffected, but the remaining 1/2 are given additional resistance to malaria. The fact that many blacks have a gene, that automatically kills a quarter of their children, speaks for itself--they have been under fundamentally different selection pressures.</p>

<p>But hey, all of this is just speculation, right? We could never make conclusions based on evolutionary history, and we all know blacks are being deprived in America, right? Except they aren&#39;t. Most American blacks have it better than a lot of people in Eastern Europe and Asia, yet still have vastly lower IQ scores. Funny how that works.</p>

<p>And all the intelligence research, including twin studies, shows IQ to be 50-80% heritable in the modern environment. Let&#39;s not forget that. </p>

<p>Saying that the black white IQ gap is due to environment, and not genetics, is like saying blacks have dark skin because they&#39;re getting more sun than whites. You have to be fucking delusional. Blacks and whites separated 50-100,000 years ago, and many populations are even more distant. We easily fit as separate species, let alone subspecies. Like Polar bears and Grizzly bears (who can interbreed fine btw, and actually have a hybridization zone and smooth continuum between the species, just like blacks and whites).</p>

<p>This is part of the equation, but really only a small part. The Flynn effect isn&#39;t exclusive to IQ test, an increase in fluid intelligence was shown e.g. here: <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21660765/">The Flynn effect in neuropsychological assessment.</a></em><br/>
And of course there&#39;s direct proof that environmental factors play a significant role in increasing intelligence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12741743">Previously hypothesized explanations (e.g., improved nutrition; increased environmental complexity; and family, parental, school, and methodological factors) for the Flynn effect are evaluated for their relevance in this community, and other potential factors are reviewed. The hypotheses that resonate best with our findings are those related to parents&#39; literacy, family structure, and children&#39;s nutrition and health.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, these factors aren&#39;t <em>everything</em>, but extremely impactful. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15734706">Simply supplementing iodine increased IQ scores by 8 points in China.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh. &quot;We&quot; can? Funny how you don&#39;t give any explanation. It&#39;s almost as if you are just talking out of your ass.</p>

<p>By we I mean everyone, since it&#39;s scientific consensus. You could take a look at Nisbeth&#39;s comprehensive review <em><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c03f/f20904c35a370534a9d3710453dd6dc7a2d2.pdf">Intelligence New Findings and Theoretical Developments</a></em>:</p>

<p>About the Black–White difference in IQ, which at the time
was about 15 points, the Neisser et al. (1996) article stated,

there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis.” That conclusion stands today: There has been no new direct evidence
on the question. </p>

<p>Feel free to read on to get to know why it does not make sense to attribute the black-white IQ differences to genetics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s put IQ on hold for a second, and focus on a few other differences between blacks and whites.</p>

<p>Why? I was talking about IQ. Of course there are genetic differences between races, I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d even have to reach for muscle fibers, when skin color is so much more obvious. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>And a deeper understanding of evolution would tell you that these kinds of conjectures are always worthless. Evolution is measurable, so put some data to your claims, because what you&#39;re saying here makes no sense.</p>

<p>Yes, and what leads you to conclude that it&#39;s based on genetic differences? Because it seems like you&#39;re, well, talking out of your ass.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And all the intelligence research, including separated twin studies, shows IQ to be 50-80% heritable in the modern environment.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 50-70%, and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/node/56158.abstract">common genetic polymorphisms explain 5% of that variation.</a> It does not mean that this percentage is caused by genetics either. Here&#39;s a good paper for you to educate yourself: <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27906501">The heritability fallacy.</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term &#39;heritability,&#39; as it is used today in human behavioral genetics, is one of the most misleading in the history of science. Contrary to popular belief, the measurable heritability of a trait does not tell us how &#39;genetically inheritable&#39; that trait is. Further, it does not inform us about what causes a trait, the relative influence of genes in the development of a trait, or the relative influence of the environment in the development of a trait.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 50-70%, and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/node/56158.abstract">common genetic polymorphisms explain 5% of that variation.</a> It does not mean that this percentage is caused by genetics either.

<p>Split some more hairs. And I know how heritability works. </p>

<p>Feel free to read on to get to know why it does not make sense to attribute the black-white IQ differences to genetics.   </p>

<p>....  </p>

<p>Saying that the black white IQ gap is due to genetics goes against established science and lacks any kind of evidence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice assertion dude. At least I backed up my claims with some speculation about evolutionary history.</p>

<p>A couple things here. For one, there absolutely is &quot;any kind&quot; of evidence--blacks, a genetic cluster, have lower IQs statistically. That, alone, is &quot;any kind&quot; of evidence. </p>

<p>Also, there is huge bias when it comes to this subject, you cannot push the idea of blacks being less intelligent without becoming a complete pariah due to the moral implications.</p>

<p>Anyway, you tell me, why do blacks have such low IQs? What factors in their environment are causing this? Even rich blacks are less intelligent than poor whites. And whites and Asians in impoverished countries still have far higher IQs. Why are blacks universally so much less intelligent, if not genes?</p>

<p>Depends on your definition of species. Do you think Polar bears and Grizzlies are the same species?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a few studies before that show small correlations between brain volume and intelligence. A few pop up on google. It seems generally accepted that there&#39;s at least a small correlation, and it&#39;s obvious why there would be.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t care about brain size. A better example for my point would be reaction time. It&#39;s also correlated with iq, and that correlation increases with age. It&#39;s a much better analogue for general brain health, since reaction time slows due to exhaustion, degenerative brain disease, intoxication, etc. (again, just google it lmao)</p>

<p>But my point is that brain health is not everything. A drunk Einstein is still Einstein.</p>

<p>Stop lying. Stop pretending to know what you&#39;re talking about. From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neurologist Barry Gordon describes the myth as false, adding, &quot;we use virtually every part of the brain, and that (most of) the brain is  active almost all the time.&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#cite_note-sciam-1">[1]</a> Neuroscientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Beyerstein">Barry Beyerstein</a> sets out seven kinds of evidence refuting the ten percent myth:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#cite_note-beyerstein-13">[13]</a>   </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Studies of brain damage: If 10 percent of the brain is normally  used, then damage to other areas should not impair performance. Instead,  there is almost no area of the brain that can be damaged without loss  of abilities. Even slight damage to small areas of the brain can have  profound effects.  </p></li>
<li><p>Brain scans have shown that no matter what one is doing, all brain  areas are always active. Some areas are more active at any one time than  others, but barring brain damage, there is no part of the brain that is  absolutely not functioning. Technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography">positron emission tomography</a> (PET) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">functional magnetic resonance imaging</a> (fMRI) allow the activity of the living brain to be monitored. They reveal that even during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep">sleep</a>, all parts of the brain show some level of activity. Only in the case of serious damage does a brain have &quot;silent&quot; areas.  </p></li>
<li><p>The brain is enormously costly to the rest of the body, in terms of  oxygen and nutrient consumption. It can require up to 20 percent of the  body&#39;s energy—more than any other organ—despite making up only 2 percent  of the human body by weight.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#cite_note-power-sciam-14">[14]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#cite_note-CarpenterCh1-15">[15]</a>  If 90 percent of it were unnecessary, there would be a large survival  advantage to humans with smaller, more efficient brains. If this were  true, the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection">natural selection</a>  would have eliminated the inefficient brain portions. It is also highly  unlikely that a brain with so much redundant matter would have evolved  in the first place; given the historical risk of death in childbirth  associated with the large brain size (and therefore skull size) of  humans,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_the_brain_myth#cite_note-16">[16]</a> there would be a strong selection pressure against such a large brain size if only 10 percent was actually in use.  </p></li>
<li><p>Localization of function: Rather than acting as a single mass, the brain has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localization_of_brain_function">distinct regions for different kinds of information processing</a>. Decades of research have gone into mapping functions onto areas of the brain, and no function-less areas have been found.  </p></li>
<li><p>Microstructural analysis: In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-unit_recording">single-unit recording</a>  technique, researchers insert a tiny electrode into the brain to  monitor the activity of a single cell. If 90 percent of cells were  unused, then this technique would have revealed that.  </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_pruning">Synaptic pruning</a>: Brain cells that are not used have a tendency to degenerate.  Hence if 90 percent of the brain were inactive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy">autopsy</a> of normal adult brains would reveal large-scale degeneration.</p></li>
