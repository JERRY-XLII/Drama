    <div class="md"><p>Let me tell you this-- <a href="/r/Drama">/r/Drama</a> is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you&#39;ll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don&#39;t even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans &quot;n[slur]&quot;), will reveal itself to you as Reddit&#39;s number one hub for the web&#39;s most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you are actively checking on that shit I could kind of see how it might slip through but it does seem pretty excessive to not notice something is up but idk. She says the only reason she knows is because her mom confessed and then she accuses her mom of paranoia because she assumed she knew they were spying on her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My mom said that I should take it as a compliment that they watch me masturbate and get off to it. Apparently it&#39;s all good because they thought I knew they were watching me and that I was even &quot;showing off for them sometimes&quot;. I don&#39;t know who the hell thinks people are just randomly spying on them all the time but anyone that does needs help with their paranoia disorder</p>

<p>Seems like a weird plot hole but with schizophrenics it&#39;s hard to know where reality ends and the delusion begins sometimes.</p>

<p>If any of this shit actually happened she needs to go to the police like yesterday, SD cards and a phone that has been tampered with to spy on some one are plenty of evidence to get a conviction. She never did because this never happened.</p>

<p>Did you really just say having experience in &quot;IT&quot; is a real qualification to tell it&#39;s bullshit? And a little bit of coding experience? Oh honey, I&#39;m so sorry you weren&#39;t smart enough to get a real degree (if you even have one and not just a bunch of certs). </p>

<p>There&#39;s this thing you can put in cameras, whether they be portable or not, called an SD card. It lets you store video or photos on there so you can look at it later. Also you can plug things into the wall, no batteries necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say your mom comes over once a week and takes the SD cards and replaces them. This means your mother is dedicating several hours per week to monitoring you, hundreds of dollars on equipment and storage as well as your premium accounts, and an additional several hours of reviewing 3 weeks worth of footage every week (since there are 3 cameras) just to find videos of you masturbating. </p>

<p>Does this level of obsession make any sense at all? doesnt she have to work and eat and sleep and do literally anything else other than obsessing over you? All you&#39;ve mentioned your parents doing in the past was installing porn blocking software and checking your email, which are both things that normal, if slightly overbearing parents tend to do. This is not at all similar to this more recent behavior you are describing. That is why it makes more sense for you to be incorrect about the fact that you are being spied on. This is a symptom of mental illness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re assuming they&#39;re watching it in its entirety and not just fast forwarding to the good parts. Who just sits there watching someone walk around and hours later be like oh shit I saw her naked? That doesn&#39;t make any sense. </p>

<p>You&#39;re also assuming they&#39;re backing up anything. </p>

<p>They&#39;re retired. It was well within their means to buy a couple small indoor security cams and a couple SD cards. The cameras thing only lasted a couple weeks at a time on and off. I really, really doubt it was 24/7 </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you got &quot;porn blocking software&quot;. Haha no. This was looking at what I was watching regularly, obsessively looking for my nudes, going through my chat logs, any accounts they had access to, and my cell phone all the way until 18 (or at least that&#39;s what I thought). All the while constantly being told I&#39;m a disgusting whore and why can&#39;t I just be like my sister.</p>

<p>I hope you never have access to children if you think that&#39;s normal behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I don&#39;t really think that&#39;s uncommon. Do you really believe teens aren&#39;t doing that?</p>

<p>You know the reason I did those videos was to get enough money to support myself right? So I wouldn&#39;t have to be trapped in their house and I could pay for college. They wouldn&#39;t teach me to drive, I lived in a rural area, and my social skills were extremely stunted. Not sure how you make money quickly in that situation. I was just some random girl, you think anyone&#39;s going to pay a ton of money for anything else besides scat or full service sex work? I was trapped in their house so full service was out of the question. If you have time to market yourself you can make money basically doing anything but that took time that I didn&#39;t have at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way to go with the reading comp there bud. Your strategy is to take a minor piece of the puzzle and turn it into the entire reason for it all? Look I know no girls ever wanted to get naked in front of you when both parties were under 18 but that&#39;s not an excuse to obsess over something so minor.</p>

<p>Were you allowed to have friends? Were you taught to drive by your school or your parents? Did you have a normal schooling experience with no multi-year long breaks of online only learning? Did you shower in peace and not have your mom expose your naked body while she yelled and shamed you starting at 12 years old? Did you ever have a diary that wasn&#39;t read? Was your bedroom door always on it&#39;s hinges?</p>

<p>Never had more than a month or two at a time where the only people you interacted with was who was at home? Never had periods where you literally weren&#39;t allowed to be in the same room as your parents for days at a time? Never had recurring nightmares of being a kid and trapped at home or one of the &quot;treatment centers&quot; they&#39;d send you? Never been told &quot;privacy is a privilege not a right&quot;? </p>

<p>Abuse is hard to spot when you grow up thinking it&#39;s normal and &quot;that&#39;s how all families are&quot;.</p>

I don&#39;t understand where you&#39;re getting this sex thing from. The only way they&#39;d be able to listen to us have sex would be through my phone mic if I had WiFi or data on.</p>

<p>Honestly what would you do if you had a bunch of video to go through? You skip around like any other person watching a long ass video. Oh wait no, I forgot, I&#39;m actually retarded and I know they&#39;re ONLY watching me masturbate and know exactly when that&#39;s happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m very happy that you had a normal childhood where your parents acted as they should. Unfortunately there&#39;s no test that dictates who gets to reproduce. </p>

<p>As for why, when someone is overly concerned with the &quot;protection&quot; aspect of parenting, things can get a little out of hand. Also when your own parental figures were mentally ill, absent, or extremely poorly educated things get a little fuzzy on how you should act as a parent yourself.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It starts with just telling them they can&#39;t go over to other kids houses and that there&#39;s absolutely no sleepovers. Then move them out of public school. That&#39;s safer. Now they&#39;re getting older, should give them an old laptop, that will make them smarter. Oh shit, they&#39;re going through puberty now and there&#39;s porn on the internet. Better look through it as much as possible and shame them for looking. </p>

<p>Now they&#39;re trying to get a little of the real thing. Definitely stop that from happening. It&#39;s middle school they&#39;re not supposed to get to 2nd base! No boyfriend&#39;s allowed and I&#39;ll continue to berate and shame you for your sexuality.</p>

<p>Your sneaking out because I won&#39;t let you have normal sexual experiences for your age!? Guess it&#39;s time we ship you off to a behavioral correction program, were not dealing with this crazy child.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m scared you&#39;re going to try to have sex with everyone. Guess you can&#39;t go to school and you definitely can&#39;t use a computer or phone anymore. No outside access and no friends means I win.</p>

<p>Oh no I made them socially retarded and they&#39;re in their mid-teens. Time to make it up to them by letting them have a phone and computer again. Gonna still take that shit away to look at it though and I&#39;ll let them have friends even though they don&#39;t even know how to make them anymore. Shit, she deletes her browser history what do we do now!? Her brother says there&#39;s something he can put on there so we know what she types. That&#39;s genius! Do it right away!</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to suspect something&#39;s going on, she&#39;s legal age and she&#39;s getting money suddenly. I&#39;m not going to scare her off though, I&#39;ll play dumb. Her brother isn&#39;t here anymore ever since he tried to choke her out while he was trying to get clean from opiates. </p>

<p>Now he&#39;s moved back but she&#39;s on her way out soon. Going to move in with her boyfriend&#39;s family and start college. I&#39;ve been supervising her all this time, what if something happens!? Good we have her schedule, get her brother to check up on her on campus. He delivers pizzas, he&#39;s got time.</p>

<p>Now her and her boyfriend are getting an apartment. They ask for moving help and we&#39;re ecstatic. She hasn&#39;t completely shut us out of her life yet! She even visits us still! She leaves her purse out whenever she&#39;s over, doesn&#39;t she know that&#39;s dangerous? We&#39;re family but still, she&#39;s just asking for us to look through it. Ha! Even her phone password is easy, it&#39;s the last few digits of her email. Her brother has started to go to school again, he says he&#39;s learned a way we can access her phone even when she&#39;s not around! Perfect, now we can know for sure that she&#39;s safe even if she moves away. </p>

<p>... She hasn&#39;t been contacting us much this past year or so. Don&#39;t want to seem overbearing so I&#39;ll just check up in private and go through her online accounts. </p>

<p>She&#39;s talking to us again! They&#39;re married! Wow I&#39;m so happy she&#39;s not going to be a prostitute or die alone. We were pretty worried there. Now they&#39;ve bought a home and she invites me over to get lunch together and other mother/daughter stuff.  Lol she even leaves me alone in her house while she gets dressed or runs to her car. She&#39;s just asking for me to look through her house, gotta make sure she&#39;s not doing drugs or anything dangerous. </p>

<p>Looking into security for the house, tried asking her husband for tips since he&#39;s good with technology. Never really answered much so we&#39;ll go for her brother. Turns out you can put up cameras really easily and you don&#39;t even need internet! This gives me an idea! Some parts of her house are messy enough where I can hide it, just need another mother/daughter bonding day so I can go in there again.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now for the sexual aspect, that threw me for a loop and I don&#39;t know when that started so I can&#39;t provide much info on their justification other than &quot;but we don&#39;t look at your face!&quot; and &quot;we thought you knew about it? You never reacted badly when you caught me in a room I wasn&#39;t supposed to be in and you&#39;ve even looked straight into the security cam before&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>My sister has no part in this, she had a very nice life compared to my brother and I. She is what we were always compared to. She doesn&#39;t have enough experience with the abuse to have any reason to believe things are as bad as they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said before, they were in a pile of parts and other random possessions of my husband. There&#39;s no reason why I would take a picture of them but I&#39;ll take a look at some older pictures I have to see if they&#39;re in the background. Usually tried to avoid the clutter in the background so there&#39;s no guarantees but it&#39;s my best option right now. </p>

<p>That SSD died a couple years ago, if it was on there when I lived at home it&#39;s gone now.</p>

<p>As for watch history on google drive, is there a way to see that even if it&#39;s from the original account? Will it say &quot;you watched this on [date]&quot; and how far back is it? Because if that&#39;s possible to get that would be amazing. I know it wouldn&#39;t be usable evidence but it would be nice if I could find out if they&#39;re bullshitting about some of it. All I have to go off of is my mom saying they did and a few specifics of the videos that weren&#39;t shown in any previews. So they very well could have only watched 1/4 of it but their other behavior makes me think she&#39;s probably telling the truth about watching every one of them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They weren&#39;t in any sex spots, man you guys&#39; are awful at reading comprehension. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, excess money means my husband just buys whatever parts he thinks might be useful and then never gets around to doing anything with them. There were three. One in the &quot;computer room&quot; where there&#39;s so much electronic junk it took longer to pack up just that room than most of the house. It&#39;s a 11&#39; x 17x room with desks covering every inch of wall. We sometimes masturbate in there since there&#39;s computers and porn.</p>

<p>I just saw that one and the one on the bookshelf in the living room. Another place where my husband&#39;s stuff was basically on every surface. </p>

<p>Again, I didn&#39;t think anything of it until my mom felt guilty about doing this while we were going out places together and bonding. She told me there was one in the master bathroom but I never saw it. Can&#39;t say for sure if there even was one there. I&#39;m just going off of what she decided to tell me combined with my own experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you actually read my comments in the original thread you&#39;d know that I assumed they were my husband&#39;s since they were in his pile of parts and other junk. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have them. She was caught wondering around in my house multiple times when I was trying to change or grab something from my car. I saw her slip something in her purse at one time but only as I was coming down the stairs so I didn&#39;t really know what she was fidgeting with. Better to ignore it than anger her I thought. </p>

<p>They were small indoor security cams, she took them before officially confessing. </p>

<p>I use Android, not sure why you think I have an iPhone. Anyway, I still have the phone so that&#39;s actually a great idea now that I know that a factory reset doesn&#39;t erase it after that person&#39;s comment informed me. Thank you so much for that reminder!</p>

<p>She gets 5% of my monthly income through Manyvids revshare. That&#39;s anywhere from $300-$1,000 extra a month for her every single month because I signed up through her referral link. While I was staying with her I threw about $500 her way to help out since she was struggling with her tax payment. </p>

<p>I know that kind of money seems like a lot to you. It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t make enough where a few hundred doesn&#39;t affect you, but you&#39;re delusional if you think that&#39;s for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well she&#39;s not really good with classic education kind of stuff. Nothing wrong with that as long as you&#39;re a nice person, everyone has their strong suites. With how she was talking about conspiracy theories, astrology, and how doctors are out to get you I didn&#39;t get the impression that there was a whole lot of logical reasoning present up there.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t see how that&#39;s inconsistent. Between my husband and I we were able to afford a house further from the city. Do you own or rent?</p>

<p>I love how you&#39;re acting like I&#39;m distributing pics that I someone have after all these years or that this is some new phenomena. In my age group it was extremely common to send nudes to each other. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s even more prevalent with how popular Snapchat is with teens. I don&#39;t support it, but people will always find ways to see each other naked. </p>

<p>I mean you can tell me I&#39;m awful for it, that&#39;s fine I guess lol. They were never on the internet for people to see and they were sent to people my age who sent pics of themselves. If you&#39;re mid twenties or younger and you&#39;ve never sent a dick pic to your highschool girlfriend, some other girl you were talking to while in highschool, or ever received anything I&#39;m proud of you. You had more restraint than I did at that age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hope they are just trolling because I know someone like this (not the thot part but the crazy part). </p>

<p>They also think they are being gang stalked but by the coworkers. With this kind of crazy, they don’t realize how much money and effort would have gone into stalking someone. Let’s say, a stalker only stalks like 6 hours a day. That’s still a huge chunk of their day.</p>

<p>With this kind of delusion, these people think they are the main protagonist of some cheesy crime thriller novel and everyone else just revolves around them. Others are just side characters who only live to make the protagonist’s life hell. They have no life whatsoever. It’s very unlikely that multiple people would conspire together and dedicate their lives just to stalk a person. </p>

<p>It’s actually fascinating.</p>

<p>They&#39;re retired. It was well within their means to buy a couple small indoor security cams and a couple SD cards. The cameras thing only lasted a couple weeks at a time on and off. I really, really doubt it was 24/7 </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how you got &quot;porn blocking software&quot;. Haha no. This was looking at what I was watching regularly, obsessively looking for my nudes, going through my chat logs, any accounts they had access to, and my cell phone all the way until 18 (or at least that&#39;s what I thought). All the while constantly being told I&#39;m a disgusting whore and why can&#39;t I just be like my sister.</p>
