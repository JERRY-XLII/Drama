<p>So I guess we need a ceddit?</p>

<p>For this, I was permabanned from r/politics, where I rarely go...for &quot;trolling.&quot;</p>

<p>Do I need larger shoes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>America was literally founded on child rape (of brown kids of course!) and continues to do so, peaking in the 20th century by providing those damn savage yonguns to the largest child molestation ring in history.</p>

<p>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOUR ILLEGITIMATE, ILLEGAL BY YOUR OWN LAWS, SETTLER STATE IS. THIS IS NOT RECENT. THIS IS NOT A THING OF THE PAST. IT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED BECAUSE AMERICA IS INHERENTLY EVIL</p>

<p>America was a leader in all of that, before Columbus. Even in the worst cases, it was better off for everybody, but especially women and queers, before colonialism began to force us to change our savage ways. Now you celebrate those ways, but still are just an imitation.</p>

<p>People call me a reactionary for wanting to go back to pre-contact life. Pre-contact, my existence as a non-binary person would be respected, venerated even. My disability would be respected and I would be helped, not out of pity but that same respect and honest care, if I were unable to do something. I would have food and shelter and water, guaranteed. By birth and nothing else, I would have access to a means of production and countless hours of training, which was given to everybody indiscriminate of sex in even the most &quot;sexist&quot; of nations that I know of. In those most &quot;sexist&quot; nations, the only things women are excluded from are some ceremonies. They also have their own ceremonies. Versus now, where we are either excluded from work or simply paid less than the already despicably low pay of the average working class person. And this is just the damned surface.</p>

<p>If re-implementing a system that worked far better and is eons more progressive than anything now is reactionary, then language has lost all meaning.</p>

<p>Repeat after me: settler America is a shithole!</p>

<p>If we saw any attempts to purposefully incite or inflame responses from other users, we would treat them as trolling. If you have a specific response you&#39;d like me to examine I&#39;d be happy to take a look - the most anyone does is suggest you&#39;ve had too much coffee. </p>

<p>We do what we can - it&#39;s an an enormous sub with the second highest activity on the site, and the political environment is not exactly conductive to cooler heads prevailing. When we see reports for personal insults, we do remove and issue temporary or permanent bans as policy dictates. Violence or physical harm - wishing, condoning or inciting - is treated with the upmost seriousness and results in an instance perma ban. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>We temporary ban for incivility and insults. We issue unttimed bans for people who are reported to be intentionally flaming or provoking users, which we classify as trolling / flaming. Such bans are eligible for an unban request after 90 days hvae passed. </p>

<p>No one should receive death threats over internet comments, and I&#39;m sorry you had that happen. I receive threats regularly and did before I was helping to mod the sub in 2016. Some people take the internet a little too seriously.</p>

<p>Do you think I want to be unbanned?  I never fucking post on your subreddit because it&#39;s full of rabid leftist morons who hit report on any conservative that shows up.  I wish to remain banned, after this, you douche.  I just want you to look at yourselves in the ferking mirror!</p>

<p>You jumped on permanently banning me tonight for NOTHING!</p>

<p>I did NOTHING wrong.  I only responded to posters and &quot;god help me&quot; used some citations.</p>

<p>Anyone with a brain would have looked and said, &quot;This is a six year old account and she is simply interacting with other posters&quot;&#39;.</p>

<p>But not you.. no.... &quot;TROLL!  BAN!&quot;</p>

<p>I mean, fuck off with that...seriously....</p>

<p>I&#39;ll wager 50 bucks that I get more death threats than you do.  I mod conservative subreddits.</p>

<p>It seems such a shame. It&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t a problem with the way political discussion occurs on the internet - SPS often has very legitimate complaints about the way that people interact with each other and the news cycle on various subreddits. I would have hoped that someone who devotes that much energy to that criticism would have a higher standard for how people should try to behave when engaging in political discussion with those who may not share their point of view. </p>
