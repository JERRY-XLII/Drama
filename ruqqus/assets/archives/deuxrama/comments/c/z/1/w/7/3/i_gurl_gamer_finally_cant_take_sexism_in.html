        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As the title says.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing Overwatch for 2+ years now, and a like most people here I’m sure, I’ve been targetted by men in voice chat that make sexist remarks.</p>

<p>Usually this consists of: “wow a girl!! Please date me! I love you!” or “all girls play Mercy.” Standard. This stuff doesn’t overly bother me, while it’s obviously sexist in nature and they treat you like you’re the only female in the world who’s ever played a game, because games are OBVIOUSLY just for men!!1</p>

<p>Tonight, however, I think was the first time I’ve gotten really horrific sexually violent remarks just because I am a woman.</p>

<p>Playing a game of comp standard. We’re losing and the team is blaming me for whatever reason (I was playing support). I had been briefly calling in vc and had typed in text to ask a dps to counter a hero not even aggressively, more of “can we please get a more spammy character for shields”.</p>

<p>After the first round, 3 men in the voice channel proceed to talk shit about me. Typical toxic shit at first just like “oh you’re a trash healer, play a character u don’t need aim for”.</p>

<p>This then turns into complete sexist remarks from all 3 as they gang up on me. They said they want to r/pe me and my mother. Told me to kill myself. Proceeded to call me a fat wh/re. Also continued on with other sexist and sexually violent remarks, mainly revolving around r/pe of me or a family member.</p>

<p>I know I should have left the voice channel retrospectively, but they were also barraging the abuse in the text chat, so I wouldn’t have been very safe.</p>

<p>This is my first run in however with sexist comments to this extent and I’m honestly super upset and mad. I can take the offhanded sexism I mentioned earlier as while it’s well sexist and awful, it’s ultimately less harmful and usually when people are like that they say it once and then stop. But this has shaken me a lot.</p>

<p>It angers me how pathetic some boys™️ can be that they feel threatened by any presense of a woman and feel they can say such vulgar sexually harrassing shit. Also no props to the other two in the game that didn’t stand up for me or ask the guys to stop or anything, appreciate it.</p>

<p>I’m sure many of you girls here have also had similar experiences and that angers me more. It just fucking ruins the gaming experience because some incel decides he wants to be sexist. It also worries me that such a person could potentially go out and commit such sexually violent acts, considering how much they threaten women online with it.</p>

<p>Apologies for the long rant, but I think I’mma avoid Overwatch for a bit till I can muck up the courage to play again or I’m with a large group of people.
Feel free to share your stories too, and if you have any tips to avoid this harrassment or to self care after receiving it, I’d be happy to know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m ranked diamond in Overwatch (read: I play it a lot) and in my hundreds of hours of gameplay I&#39;ve almost never seen any outright sexual harassment or abuse. I think I&#39;ve only heard someone call a girl a cunt twice. Maybe a shitty joke about only playing healers (which they almost always do). It&#39;s so exceedingly rare, and not out of frequency with people generally abusing each other for playing like shit. In fact, I think people are more likely to excuse shitty performance for girls than for guys. </p>

<p>This girl is probably an annoying cunt who talks way too much on voice comms and tries to micromanage everything even though she barely knows what she&#39;s talking about. She needs to realize that when you piss people off in a way that makes them want to attack you, they will tailor their attacks to your person to have the biggest impact possible. If you&#39;re a guy they will call you a faggot and if you&#39;re a girl they will call you a cunt or slut. The trick is to just not be annoying and realize the game is toxic in general, nobody truly gives a shit about your gender they just want to win.</p>
