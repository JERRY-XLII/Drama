        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Cool music. So, that’s where they got the poster idea for cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<p>Cute love story. Why is he always wearing a windbreaker in his apartment and also while driving though? It’s not like he’s driving a motorcycle.</p>

<p>Nevermind! He’s a cuck! Helping out someone’s wife and kid risking his own life 🤦🏻‍♀️ oh, the curvy redhead from mad men. Oh, shit! He dead. Adios or is that racist? </p>

<p>OMG! Ryan just hit a woman? There’s no reason to hit a woman!!! Get it, men?? Oh, shit.  She dead too!</p>

<p>Breaking bad guy is right. A lot of guys mess around with married women but only Ryan is cuck enough to pay back the husband’s debt and all she did was hold his hand. He didn’t even get any. Taking all that pumped up sexual frustration out with a 🔨 oh, so he’s also an incel!</p>

<p>So, he’s working for Hellboy but ended up stealing hellboy’s money 🤦🏻‍♀️ yeah, gurl! Slap his face. He probably liked that though being a cuck that he is. See? He got turned on and now he’s kissing her. I knew it! </p>

<p>Damn, he crazy stomping that guy’s face in. So, hellboy is stealing from his own family. Ryan is exercising his white man privilege by walking around with blood soaked windbreakers. He could have just taken them off but that’s not cool, I guess 🙄</p>

<p>Oh, I see this is how white male mass shooters are made. By being a giant cuck. For a second there, I thought he’s gonna shoot everyone in the pizza shop. My bad. Oh but white men also run over people in their car at KKK rallies so I guess I’m still right. </p>

<p>It’s a really deep movie. It’s obvious that the lead is an incel cuck psycho who killed the husband and everyone else. He’s not a good looking guy in a windbreaker who’s gifted at driving. That’s just his fantasy where he’s the hero of the story. I’m also thankful that it kickstarted synthwave and the whole ‘80s throwback because I’m all for that shit.</p>

<p>Good movie 3.5/5.</p>
