<p>some choice LOLs from OP ([comments] + emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My fear is, there are <strong>very good people here, who have sunk endless hours into moderating these communities</strong> [FOR FREE 🤣🤣] that they love so much, are <strong>thought of highly within their communities</strong> [COPE 😆 NOPE], are ambassadors for the Reddit brand and values, and <strong>who have donated their valuable finite time on earth to voluntarily keep a community clean</strong> [CLEAN IT UP JANNIE. YOURE NEVER GETTING YOUR YOUTH BACK 💀], functional and relevant, <strong>who are in danger of one day, being removed</strong> [DAY OF THE MOP WHEN? 🤔] by someone who has contributed nothing to the community and felt like doing one click on the base of a &quot;EH, I CAN&quot; moment, with zero recourse or way to have it rectified.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;casual&quot; mods. These group are the newbies who are active on Reddit but don&#39;t post large numbers of mod actions. <strong>They tend to sheepishly moderate</strong>, through either fear of accidentally treading on the toes of the veterans, or <strong>because moderating is a hobby and they casually do it in very little spare time.</strong> [ALL MOPPING IS A HOBBY. NOT A JOB JANNY 🤕]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>This stuff <strong>obliterates the moderator spirit, which was held with such a high honour once upon a time</strong> [NO COMMENT 😂], and is now doomed to look forever like a shady &quot;regulars&quot; club.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>theres good COPE AND SEETHE in comments too</p>

<p>What. I don&#39;t even get your point. You seem to be pointing and laughing at my post for the very same reason I posted it. Because I&#39;m anti-mods and against power mods because its pathetic that a group of people think they have any real power and care about karma. I find the way they think they run reddit to be embarrassingly pathetic and these people have no life. They disrupt reddit and operations and make good subreddits terrible places to be and think they&#39;re the equivalent of a president of a major corporation whilst the real president of this major corporation, profits from their free labour. </p>

<p>Why are you mocking me for calling them out for that shit? Isn&#39;t the whole point of this post that these people suck and that Reddit is going down the shitter because of these people? Don&#39;t you want hands off mods who don&#39;t censor shit based on how annoyed they are at one user?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get your point in aiming this at someone who is seemingly on your side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why can&#39;t we have a conversation? Why have you got to keep up this bizarre &quot;im rly dedicated to the jannie meme LUL&quot; speak that is making me question whether you have some bizarre meta cuck going on, or you&#39;re 15 years old and jealous you&#39;re not a mod or something.</p>

<p>Talk to me like an adult.</p>

<p>My view is that Reddit does a lot of good for this world, and that having a &quot;anonymous-ish&quot; forum for people to vent their frustrations, ask for advice and generally be able to communicate in a way they may feel uncomfortable with IRL, scared to or unsure about is great. Having self-moderated subs that can group people together for any reason is a fantastic thing and Reddit historically (okay maybe not much now) have always sat outside of the whole &quot;giant corporation&quot; family  friendly content wrapper.</p>

<p>If a corporation monitored Reddit, do you think your post attacking me and my argument would be allowed? Do you think a sub that creates meta-drama on their platform would exist? No, but they allow it because they don&#39;t moderate it, we do.</p>

<p>Being a part of a community is great, and having rules to make sure that people who post in each one are here for the right reason and don&#39;t post bad things is required. Unmoderated subs generally decline into echo chambers of reposts or stuff that isn&#39;t relavant. Are you honestly telling me that subs posting child pornography and credit card numbers would be &quot;RLY FUNNY LOL&quot; or would it just be a necessity that some stuff needs to be kept at bay?</p>

<p>Do you want people like me clogging up your community who &quot;don&#39;t get it&quot;? Or are you glad I can be removed or banned and that people who don&#39;t fit can be removed?</p>

<p>Ultimately, I accept Reddit has a lot of flaws, but I also accept there&#39;s a reason that you and many of these users are here and not elsewhere. If you truly thought Reddit was flawed and so stupid to have moderators, you wouldn&#39;t be active in a sub that has... moderators. You&#39;d be on another platform that isn&#39;t moderated and saying and doing whatever. I&#39;m sure you have an account on Reddit that does follow the rules and contributes validly to other subs.</p>

<p>I think some moderators are in love with the concept of moderating and having some sort of power to wield on people and wear the size of their subs and karma count as some bizarre medal of honour. I think others get enjoyment out of moderating subs as a hobby and like taking part in keeping their communities safe and productive. A lot of mods do a good job, like the ones here I am sure.</p>

<p>So I do get your point and your campaign, but I don&#39;t get why you&#39;re attacking me, someone who has banned hardly any users, gives everyone a second chance, doesn&#39;t live on Reddit, balances it with personal life, doesn&#39;t listen to the admins, hates powermods and powertrippers, thinks the concept of working for free is dumb so therefore makes it a hobby and not a job, and generally enjoys their contributions to building online communities where they can be someone else.</p>

<p>So I ask you, do you really think that people aren&#39;t allowed to &quot;clean up the place on behalf of Reddit&quot; if it&#39;s a community of users they&#39;ve built from scratch, exploring new thoughts and ideas that they thought they were alone with and have never ever had a contribution or heard from someone who works at Reddit, because they&#39;re happy doing their thing in a community of 300 people?</p>
