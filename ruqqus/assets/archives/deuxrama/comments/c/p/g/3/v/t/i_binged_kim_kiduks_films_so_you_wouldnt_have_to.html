        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not all but most I could get a hold of and/or seemed interesting to me. Some spoilers ahead. His movies are quite unique and set in very weird premises. If you like to give them a shot, read my take at your own risk. I went in blind and it’s better that way</p>

<p><strong>Birdcage Inn (1998)</strong></p>

<p>It’s about a young prostitute who moved to this small town. She was living at this house and the owner family is basically her pimps. It’s about her interactions with each of the family members. Men being men 🙄 the father and the son were lusting over her. The mom was all about money and the sexually repressed daughter thought the prostitute was beneath her. </p>

<p>I’ll give this 3/5.</p>

<p><strong>The Isle (2000)</strong></p>

<p>This one is about a fugitive hiding at a fishing spot operated by a woman who had monopoly on this business in the area. She would take the visitors who wanted to stay at these fishing spots with her little boat. But this is not about capitalism. I’m seeing a theme here because she also whored herself out sometimes. The fugitive and the business owner / prostitute became obsessed with each other. Fishing hooks were used throughout to insert in things inching the vagina. It was horrifying. </p>

<p>I’ll give this 2/5.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Guy (2001)</strong></p>

<p>This one is like an incel wet dream. So, this bad guy saw a girl and he kept observing her. She was with another guy who looked like a cuck. Anyway, the bad guy just walked up to them in the crowd and kissed the girl. She was terrified and so was the cuck. Some things were said and it hurt the bad guy/incel’s pride or something. It was hard to tell because he didn’t say anything. Another theme I’m seeing in his movies is there’s not much dialogue. Anyway, the bad guy began planning for revenge. He made the girl went into a lot of debt and made her into a prostitute. Yup, another prostitution theme. So, he was pimping her out but she just didn’t know it. He would creepily watch her through a one way glass when she was with her clients. </p>

<p>I really like this one. 3.5/5</p>

<p><strong>Samaritan Girl (2004)</strong></p>

<p>This one is about two teenage schoolgirls who wanted to go to Europe but couldn’t afford to. Instead of asking their parents or finding a sugar daddy, these two idiots, you guessed it right, resorted prostitution. One slept around and the other one acted as a pimp. The pimp one really screwed the pooch as the lookout and the police got to her friend making her jump out the window because they are both idiots. Of course, she broke her bones and died. The pimp friend blamed her friend’s death on herself and decided to return the money to the clients but that’s not enough for some reason. She decided to sleep with them herself 🤔 </p>

<p>I don’t get this one. 1/5</p>

<p><strong>3-Iron (2004)</strong></p>

<p>This one is the incel worst nightmare. Complete opposite of the bad guy. So, this is woman married a rich guy but you know, he’s no the good husband. This Chad with a motorcycle who went around like a hippie thought the house was empty and decided to be a freeloader but the wife came back to the house and saw Chad jerking himself off. She fell for her instantly. I wonder why 🙄 it turned into this sweet love story between them. Again, no dialogue. She was literally (not an exaggeration) doing things with Chad right in front of her rich husband like those porn things where the husband was oblivious about his wife getting plowed behind a counter. Well, in this movie, there’s not even any counters, they just plow right behind the husband’s back like literally. Chad would be standing a few inches behind the husband but either the husband was too old and senile or Chad was so car like, they didn’t get caught. </p>

<p>Recommended for cucks. 2/5</p>

<p><strong>The Bow (2005)</strong> </p>

<p>This one confused me the most. I know there’s some metaphor / deeper meaning going on but I’m not smart enough to figure it out. Another fishing boat story. This old pedo and a very young teenage girl agreed to get married when she’s old enough. At least I think that’s what they were. Again, there’s not much dialogue going on. Then, a young Chad came around and they started falling for each other. Chad decided to peek at night and saw the old pedo was giving a bath to the girl. He was like 🤔 that’s not even the weirdest part. The girl saw her and smirked him like, “yeah, do you like what you see?” And it just got worse from there.</p>

<p>Too pedo. 1/5</p>

<p><strong>Beautiful (2008)</strong></p>

<p>Another incel wet dream. Damn. This woman was considered very beautiful by all the male characters in the movie. She was a bit full of herself but not a bad person. She had a friend who’s, you know, like a 4 and she liked talking to this one fat chick. Anyway, one guy was really obsessed with her and ended up raping her and recorded it. He then confessed it to the police even though she never reported the rape. The police officer was practically getting off on the video while another one was feeling sorry for her. The woman began eating a lot to become fat and unattractive but men being incels, all of them just wanted to rape her. </p>

<p>I really liked this one because I underhand how it’s a burden to be beautiful, sweaty 💅🏼 4/5</p>

<p>** Pietà (2012)**</p>

<p>This guy is your regular dark, brooding, single bad boy asshole. He’s a debt collector and he would hurt people for a living. Then, he met a woman who’s claiming to be his long lost mother. So far so god but wait dude’s got some mommy fetish going on. Gross.</p>

<p>Overall, I liked the gritty atmosphere of it. Very nice chance of pace in the visuals compared to the older films. I liked the acting too but could have been better. 3/5</p>

<p><strong>Moebius (2013)</strong></p>

<p>This is actually the first movie I saw from this director and it made me want to check his earlier stuff out. This one is a doozy. No dialogue exchanged between the main characters as far as I remember. The mom got really mad the dad for cheating on her. She became like TwoX and <del>went completely crazy</del> decided to tackle toxic masculinity at its source. Cut off the husband dick off but the husband caught her before she could so she did the next best thing she could think of. Prevent a man from becoming toxic in the first place. She cut off her son’s dick off instead. The husband tried to get her to give her son’s cut off dick back in hopes of reattaching it but she ate it. Guess what? The movie got weirder from there but I won’t spoil it further.</p>

<p>Loved it. Girl power! Toxic masculinity <del>smashed</del> plucked out from the root 🤭 5/5</p>
