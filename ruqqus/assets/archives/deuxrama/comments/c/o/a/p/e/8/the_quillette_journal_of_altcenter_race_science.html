    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m tired of this fucking meme. Yes, gamers are hated by society for having no life, while the average person takes orders from the TV 4 hours per day. Gamers are hated on reddit, for wanting our moneys worth. Reddit is super liberal, until a gamer stands up to a corporation. Then it&#39;s oh that virgin gamer is upset that the female body is now covered. No, I appreciate art, culture, and the female body. The gamers rise up meme is hate speech against people with a video game hobby. Should we slut shame, or shame an alcoholic? No? Then STOP this gamers rise up nonsense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quillette is a magazine with a pretty laissez-faire attitude toward its writers commitments and hence acts as a place that most any ideology (except for maybe woke radlibism) can write an article staking out its own position and arguing for it; this comes from the fact that Quillette’s motivating principle is a concern that the public discourse has been too thoroughly policed, largely by the left. The left sees this as dangerous because because Quillette is a magazine that is pretty open to positions which the left can’t countenance for moral or political reasons (including, it should be said, things as diverse as race science to black conservatism to IDW-style centrism to the hoaxed anti-woke Marxism-Leninism) but also doesn’t want to argue about because they fear that these kind of arguments could actually be compelling. Quillette is a place where the liberals and New Atheists from the Bush era would have enjoyed arguing, but since woke radlibism eventually became the dominant force within the activist part of the American left, they disdain Quillette’s role in saying “there was another way” that this group’s political commitments could have developed; woke post-New-Atheists want their moral and political commitments to be the only ones that could have been held by good New Atheists and Quillette is threatening that position.</p>
