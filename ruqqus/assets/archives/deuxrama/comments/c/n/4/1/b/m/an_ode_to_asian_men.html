        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2019-08-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/HardIsLife.html">HardIsLife</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I cannot count the amount of times that as an Asian woman, I’ve been told I’m exotic, submissive, a “perfect waifu”, etc, by some creepy neckbeard. What prompted me to make this post actually was a completely unsolicited message about how “my inferior Asian body should worship his white dick.” When I responded, “Nah, I actually like Asian guys and don’t think they’re inferior, sorry.” I was met with a tirade of explicit insults and a rant about how I’m never going to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Asian men are often perpetuated as “soyboys”: weak, submissive, non-sexual, undateable, small dick, whatever. You’ve heard it all before and more I’m sure. That kind of racism is spread not only by white men with yellow fever who want to date Asian women but hate Asian men, but sadly also Asian women who can be self-hating and insecure about their role in society. I speak from experience, as a mixed white / East Asian woman who grew up in America.</p>

<p>These stereotypes are untrue, racist, hateful, and often ignored by other minorities who speak out about activism and racism. Asian men do not deserve to be racially stereotyped, cast aside, and ridiculed. When a white man dates an Asian woman, people applaud the man for getting a “cute little asian housewife so dainty!!”. When an Asian man dates a woman of another ethnicity, everyone is like “Wtf? What is wrong with her? He probably has a small dick why is she dating HIM? WHO IS THE WOMAN IN THE RELATIONSHIP LOL!!” (I’ve literally heard that last one said to my face, the person thought I would agree because I’m an Asian woman, I guess?)</p>

<p>I fucking love Asian men. I love my fellow Asians in general! Us Asian women need to stand up for our Asian brothers. We both face those stereotypes, and it is doubly racist and harmful - even though the same stereotype that allows Asian women to be accepted into a racist white society (albeit as a second class) cruelly marks Asian men as something lesser than a man: a joke. Either a non-sexual entity or the Hollywood stereotype that Asian men are gay and bottoms. Obviously, there’s nothing wrong with an Asian man being who he wants to be, but to be forced into a box by a stereotype that isn’t even true? Racist. Harmful. Despicable.</p>

<p>Every Asian man I’ve ever met has been incredibly hardworking, dedicated, kind but humble, fiercely sexy, and ... hot as fuck. Asian women, let’s stop white-worshipping, and white dudes - stop dming me and asking why I only like Asian men and telling me you can show me how a “real man” is. It’s gross.</p>

<p>Edit: guys I’m getting harassed by white people for being “a racist Asian girl” now oof....</p>

This man is a sick fuck. He also was banned for describing wanting to rape a 10 year old girl as part of a “big brother/little sister” rape fantasy of his on <a href="/r/justneckbeardthings">/r/justneckbeardthings</a>. Recently he has taken to harassing people on Reddit who call him out as well as doubling down on why his pedophilia and mild hebephilia should be viewed as a legitimate orientation and anyone who doesn’t agree with him is automatically a bigot or a troll or an alt. Also <a href="/u/LGLL26">/u/LGLL26</a>(suspended) and <a href="/u/CoupeMaster">/u/CoupeMaster</a> might be one of his alts as well and <a href="/u/PRs4MyWaifu">/u/PRs4MyWaifu</a> is a fake alt he gave. He’s expressed interest in having “cute half Asian daughters but no boys because they have mental problems” which might be a front for saying he wants daughters so he can live out his fantasy of raping “real life lolis” as he doesn’t have much interest in boys though he did say he likes “twink” underage boys and finds their bodies very attractive. This person has also admitted to keeping a photo album full of pictures of children that he masturbates too and has mentioned using sunglasses to hide the fact that he enjoys leering at little girls. He’s also expressed his interest in traveling to Asian countries where trafficking underage children is very common. If you actually know this man and you have children it is ill advised to continue associating with him. Another development is that he’s recently expressed his interest in adopting a little girl to “raise and adore” as he put it, I don’t think I have to tell you what he really intends. There’s also a good chance he may have fled his home country of Hungary and gone to Switzerland or Sweden to escape a rape charge involving an underage girl, not a “legal but underage” girl but one who was too young. Take the last few parts with a grain of salt as this guy routinely lies about where he is from and has lied about his ethnicity as well. He also routinely lies about his health and weight as well, he is either obese or “scrawny.” This isn’t me going after someone for thought crimes, he fully intends to offend one day if he hasn’t already by this point. I’d also like to add that if you happen to know an Asian woman(possibly East Asian, Chinese, Korean or Japanese) attending school in Hungary or Sweden or Switzerland, between the ages of 18 and 26, standing at 4’10 to 5’3 please reach out to her immediately. This man has expressed his “interests” in capturing the quote “real life loli and doing so many fun things with her little loli body.” This man is dangerous so please if you know anyone in the countries mentioned who fits this description please tell her to be on her guard at all times. Also if you’re an Asian woman keep in mind he’s directly said that your entire race’s purpose is to “serve as perfect substitutes for pedophiles and hebephiles.” Another recent development regarding this subhuman cyst: he has started fabricating stories about himself being the victim of sexual assault at the age of 10 at the hands of an alleged aunt. This is a bogus claim as the “scenario” he described is the same scenario he previously described as wanting to act out with a 10-year old girl, namely this girl crying while he told her “Let uncle enjoy your cute loli body.” So he’s an even bigger piece of shit now that he’s added false rape/abuse/molestation claims to his scum resume. </p>

<p>Also here’s a helpful link for anyone seeing this 
<a href="https://report.cybertip.org/">https://report.cybertip.org/</a></p>

<p>There’s also a little link here to a story he wanted to write <a href="https://snew.notabug.io/r/anime/comments/b6ieik/do_you_think_this_light_novel_idea_could/">https://snew.notabug.io/r/anime/comments/b6ieik/do_you_think_this_light_novel_idea_could/</a></p>

<p>Along with the post he made about wanting to adopt a little girl(will edit if he deletes but I have the screenshot) <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b5d6rz/it_should_be_legal_for_fit_single_men_in_their/">https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b5d6rz/it_should_be_legal_for_fit_single_men_in_their/</a></p>

<p>He has biastophilic urges as well 
<a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/p6YRSLp">https://m.imgur.com/a/p6YRSLp</a></p>

<p>And here he is once again proving he wants to rape whatever unfortunate child he adopts
