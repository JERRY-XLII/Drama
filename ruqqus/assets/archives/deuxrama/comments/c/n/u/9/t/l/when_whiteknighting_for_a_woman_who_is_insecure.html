    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. You could also argue their insecurity makes them complete drags to be around and makes them shitty people for taking everything too seriously while belittling everyone around them so they can feel better about themselves. Like the ones who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/smallboobproblems/comments/cnb43n/envy/">treat their sisters poorly</a> because they are jealous of their sister&#39;s breasts. They deserve to be mocked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where in that post did OP even say she treats her sister poorly? She just wishes she wasn&#39;t completely flat. She and her sister share genetics so I imagine that has be a little tough, but OP said she like buys her sister bras and stuff sometimes. That sounds like a nice thing to do.</p>

<p>Plus, most people in that subreddit don&#39;t just sit around moping about their boobs all day. It&#39;s typically a private thing that they keep to themselves. People are insecure don&#39;t often want to talk about their insecurities.</p>

Exactly what I just said. Mental illness should not be validated.</p>

<p>Nice theory. Looks like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blackredrosepetals">OP</a> spends 100% of their time on reddit complaining about their breasts while posting pics of them for people to rate.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/livipup.html">livipup</a> 2019-08-08</p>
    <div class="md"><p>When mental illness isn&#39;t validated it makes people less willing to seek help. That&#39;s why groups for alcoholics, addicts, people with eating disorders, people with depression, and people with anxiety are all common. People are more likely to get help when they can see how bad the same problems they have are impacting other people. You&#39;re more likely to tell somebody else who&#39;s struggling to get help than you are to seek help yourself. Eventually you realize you&#39;re a hypocrite for not seeking help and maybe you do so yourself. Also, sometimes people with mental illnesses don&#39;t know how to get help so going to places where other people with mental illnesses hang out can be a good way to find help. Quite a lot of people on that subreddit and similar ones do suffer from body dysmorphia and talking to other people about it helps them. OP for example, she made a post complaining that her shoulders are too broad. If you look at her pictures you can see that they aren&#39;t. She&#39;s well within an average range for shoulder width for women of her height. You can tell just by looking at her. Doesn&#39;t change how she feels though. If she sees this post it will be kinda like beating a man in a wheelchair. He&#39;s clearly injured and you just injure him even more. In this case you would just be making her illness even worse. It&#39;s not even about validating or invalidating her at that point. It&#39;s just about being cruel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeking out people with the same insecurities literally validates their own delusions because no one is there to tell them it isn&#39;t normal behavior. It makes them WORSE.</p>

<p>The only way to get over mental issues is to confront them head on and when people live in an echo chamber with like-minded people who are too afraid to offend each other they are never made to confront the root problems and feed off of each other&#39;s negative energy which validates their feelings. Their feelings should be invalidated because they are harmful to them.</p>

<p>Do you realize how silly that sounds? Comparing hurt feelings to paralysis? Comparing words to violence?</p>
