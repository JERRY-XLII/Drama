        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Do you guys know about Paramore Chad story? It‚Äôs a classic Chad tale.</p>

<p>Paramore‚Äôs frontwoman Hayley was married to a guy who‚Äôs literally named Chad. He‚Äôs from New Found Glory, a mediocre band. She met him when she‚Äôs around 17 ü§≠ he‚Äôs in his late 20s and was married to another woman. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/iKjHDte.jpg">Here is a pic</a> from wrapped tour 2007. Chad is on the right. You can tell from Hayley‚Äôs Misery Business era hair and pay attention to the faded color of her hair. Hayley was born in December 1988. She was around 19 then. It‚Äôs unclear when they met exactly but I‚Äôve heard before that it was around that time.</p>

<p>Hayley was previously dating her own band mate Josh who‚Äôs her age and they grew up together. This is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ANuVkIY.jpgSoon">them</a>. Hayley had the same misery business hair but it was not yet faded. So, this happened in the span of a few weeks or a couple of months. </p>

<p>The timeline here is very overlapped. In this <a href="https://i.imgur.com/F20Oe6t.jpg">picture</a> (Josh, Chad, two random dudes, Hayley - left to right), Josh might have already been getting cucked.</p>

<p>And Chad‚Äôs then wife, Chad, Hayley, Josh are all in the same <a href="https://i.imgur.com/22lvlIb.jpg">photo here.</a></p>

<p>And she looks like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/fhEpUt0.jpg">this</a> lol very similar to Hayley.</p>

<p>You see her with exact same hair in this <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nGeL9wB.jpg">picture</a> and it‚Äôs obvious they are already dating.</p>

<p>Soon after, Hayley and Josh kept being passive aggressive towards each other. Brand New Eyes album was just Hayley taking passive aggressive shots at Josh. After the tour, Josh left the band and his brother followed him. When he announced the news, fans painted Josh as the bad guy and all.</p>

<p>Years later, Hayley and Chad got married. But while they were engaged, Chad cheated on her with one of her close friends. Yet she still married him. In an interview in recent years, she said she shouldn‚Äôt have married Chad.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why the lyrics in their latest album are so dark and depressing. She even wrote a song about how people like to say to her ‚Äútold you so‚Äù. Chad‚Äôs ex-wife also wrote a song years ago after the divorce warning Hayley that he would do the same thing to her in the future.</p>

<p>The info of the girl was first leaked on tumblr folleoed by Reddit. While Paramore was touring for their Parahoy!, I saw the pictures of the girl and Chad together on her Instagram. So, the timeline matched up too. Chad was taking his own tour while engaged with Hayley when she‚Äôs touring for Paramore concerts.</p>

<p>Those two twilight songs by Paramore were written for Chad. Now she cries when she sings about them. Josh and Hayley hadn‚Äôt talked in years expect once when they ran into each other in the neighborhood. Josh‚Äôs brother Zac did come back to Paramore for the latest album and still very much in touch with Hayley. They are all from the same home town, Franklin. Josh is now happily married. </p>

<p>Well there&#39;s a million other girls who do it just like you

<p>Whoa, well I never meant to brag
But I&#39;ve gotten what I wanted now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
