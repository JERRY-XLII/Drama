    <div class="md"><p>whenever someone is clearly doing a troll post you will get one of the mods or just some jackass saying &quot;LMAO THIS IS BAIT!! HA HA HA&quot; like they are in on the joke.</p>

<p>imagine you are watching a movie and some asshole yells out spoilers. it ruins the total performance. just shut the fuck up, like a good retard, and enjoy the show. dont be such an idiot and scream like you and the writers are on the same level because you are not. it is art.</p>

<p>i have literally seen countless posts where bait is ruined because some faggot points out it is bait so they can feel internet savvy. i am actually very angry.</p>

<p><a href="https://discord.gg/T2cZq88">https://discord.gg/T2cZq88</a> is the discord, join vc</p>

<p>Kast bout the absolute dumpster fire draining money rabb.it and shut it down, redircting it to their site</p>

<p>This person <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/pjo25h.png">https://files.catbox.moe/pjo25h.png</a> is the lead community person that&#39;s talking to everyone LMAO</p>

<p>I asked this</p>

<p>rabb.it used the unsustainable model of &quot;a virtual machine for every watch party&quot;, which is just not affordable, and people won&#39;t be willing to pay for that. how will you technically structure your own systems to ensure any streaming video on the web is streamable for a group while ensuring that you don&#39;t spend money on 1 VM per session (not that this is hard, it isn&#39;t, but i&#39;d like to make sure you know how to do so)</p>

<p>which was the core issue for rabbit shutting down</p>

<p>and he didn&#39;t have an answer LOL. he said they needed to &#39;look deeper into rabbit&#39;s infrastructure&#39; after they &#39;put out the fires over the past two days&#39; wtf prepare for this shit</p>

<p>some dude named &#39;corestormy&#39; said he had secret info about kast&#39;s misconduct he&#39;d give if u dmed him, but he didn&#39;t enable dms from server members so nobody could</p>

<p>a lot of people are mad that he&#39;s decieving them and stuff. TRAINWRECK. they had the wrong guy do this, with quotes like &quot;and number three ... wait i already used three ... no four&quot;</p>

<p>also rabbit barely worked, so they bought it and now rabb.it redirects you to kast, which ... doesn&#39;t work. geniuses.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Just heard him say, to a technical question, &quot;hey so it&#39;s because ... oh one of the devs is motioning at me to not answer ha ha ha ha ha&quot;</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<p>the absolute lad pestomime is asking dumb questions and he&#39;s answered EVERY SINGLE ONE</p>

<p>@1st Kast Lead EXCUSE ME SIR, may i please use rabbit on my web explorer again? Sir response: &lt;</p>

<p>pestomime:I don&#39;t want to pay you response: &quot;you dont have to, people who pay us will pay us&quot;</p>

<p>pestomime:@1st Kast Lead can you please put it on the dark web instead?</p>

<p>pestomime:@1st Kast Lead SIR SIR SIR, please let me use your new service on the dark web to avoid the FBI. response: &quot;yes just use tor&quot;</p>

<p>pestomime :Tor? Okay I can do that as long as nobody in the government can see my searches. @1st Kast Lead thank you for answering my questions an old dart like me can get confused at computer. @1st Kast Lead tor is very good for dark web!!! response: &quot;yeah uh ok&quot;</p>

<p>pestomime @1st Kast Lead are the developers mad at you? response: &quot;not sure what you mean pesto&quot;</p>

<p>pestomime:It seems like they were making angery face at you because they are all in disagreement. It must be very stressful to monotize response: &quot;bla bla bla oh someone said you&#39;re a troll i see&quot;</p>

<p>pestomime:@1st Kast Lead is it possible to put the developer on the phone? r</p>
