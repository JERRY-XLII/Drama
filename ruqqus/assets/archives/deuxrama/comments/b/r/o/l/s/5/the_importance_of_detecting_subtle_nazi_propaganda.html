    <div class="md"><p>Are you comparing the way some use vegetarianism with other ways they can avoid ? Hmm, I&#39;d say that this would be different. They aren&#39;t using it to keep their political views obscured, just to make themselves associated with nice people. What I&#39;ve been talking about in this post is mainly about hiding from the fact that they&#39;re nazis, not making nazis look better.  </p>

<p>The answer is no, by the way. That&#39;s not what my reasoning was even for stuff like milk and the ok hand. Vegetarianism is even more so unnecessary to abandon because according to you, they&#39;re not using it as a symbol, or dog whistle. They&#39;re only using it for a little better PR.  </p>

<p>You mixed up vegan and vegetarian at the end there too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You realize you have the cart before the horse on this right. You claim nazi&#39;s are signaling each other covertly so others don&#39;t  notice, and your proof is a symbol a troll pretended was a nazi symbol and it became famous so nazis started using it. If they started using it <em>after</em> a troll invented it and it became famous then it&#39;s not covert is it? It&#39;s literally the opposite of covert. So which is it, a covert symbol or a famous symbol? It can&#39;t be both. </p>

<p>PS it also can&#39;t  be plausible deniability, because if it&#39;s truly plausible people do that and <em>aren&#39;t nazis</em> then the one receiving the signal can never be sure if it&#39;s truly a fellow nazi giving it or it&#39;s just noise cause everyone does it.</p>

<p>I agree. If I see someone flashing an OK hand in front of a swastika, it&#39;s a decent giveaway that he&#39;s a nazi. </p>

<p>If I see a video of someone saying &quot;kill all blacks&quot; while wearing a pepe t-shirt, it&#39;s safe to say he&#39;s a nazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine caring about what some YouTube talking head thinks.</p>

<p>Form your own opinions. Think for yourself. Build up your beliefs and then defend your them yourself. Your use of other people&#39;s arguments and debates shows that you don&#39;t really put much critical thinking into your beliefs and most likely don&#39;t consider other perspective than the one you have some random YouTuber spoon-feed you. If you keep using other people&#39;s arguments to form your beliefs, you&#39;re just going to become easily manipulated. Try to find less manipulative and biased sources, this rules out YouTube and documentaries, to build your beliefs. If you can&#39;t find any relatively low bias sources, look at sources from all non-super-extremist viewpoints, this rules out sources like Stormfront not Fox News, and then think about the subject. So many people fall into these opinion givers like Contrapoints for the left and similar people on the right (I can&#39;t think of any ATM) and just listen to them uncritically because they&#39;re reasonably charismatic and can build a decent argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to try to <em>prove</em> myself to you, but whatever.
I get most of my news from NPR, and regularly read books on philosophy and politics. Just because someone else thought of something first doesn’t make it wrong, yeah doesn’t mean it’s right but that’s why you think about it. 
Also, they don’t always think of it first, they just are often better skilled in displaying the idea. Why reinvent the wheel? Actually I can answer that, to better understand how the wheel works. I guess I often do that in arguing like this because it’d be months since I last learned about a topic and I have to figure it out again on my own.</p>

<p>You’ve made some incorrect assumptions about me.</p>

<p>Ughh... I feel like I’m getting too close to r/iamverysmart, but I don’t know how else to respond
to this type of accusation other than ignoring it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How often do you read opinions from someone you disagree with? Political/philosophy books are almost as biased as youtubers. If you don&#39;t look at a variety of viewpoints, especially those you disagree with, you won&#39;t get anything except manipulated.

<p>Your comments make it very clear that you have a black and white view of the world. You fail to look into the reasons behind other&#39;s beliefs/actions and it shows in your responses here.</p>
