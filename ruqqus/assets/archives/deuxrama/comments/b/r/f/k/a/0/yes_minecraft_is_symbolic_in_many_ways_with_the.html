    <div class="md"><p>America was literally founded on child rape (of brown kids of course!) and continues to do so, peaking in the 20th century by providing those damn savage yonguns to the largest child molestation ring in history.</p>

<p>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOUR ILLEGITIMATE, ILLEGAL BY YOUR OWN LAWS, SETTLER STATE IS. THIS IS NOT RECENT. THIS IS NOT A THING OF THE PAST. IT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED BECAUSE AMERICA IS INHERENTLY EVIL</p>

<p>America was a leader in all of that, before Columbus. Even in the worst cases, it was better off for everybody, but especially women and queers, before colonialism began to force us to change our savage ways. Now you celebrate those ways, but still are just an imitation.</p>

<p>People call me a reactionary for wanting to go back to pre-contact life. Pre-contact, my existence as a non-binary person would be respected, venerated even. My disability would be respected and I would be helped, not out of pity but that same respect and honest care, if I were unable to do something. I would have food and shelter and water, guaranteed. By birth and nothing else, I would have access to a means of production and countless hours of training, which was given to everybody indiscriminate of sex in even the most &quot;sexist&quot; of nations that I know of. In those most &quot;sexist&quot; nations, the only things women are excluded from are some ceremonies. They also have their own ceremonies. Versus now, where we are either excluded from work or simply paid less than the already despicably low pay of the average working class person. And this is just the damned surface.</p>

<p>If re-implementing a system that worked far better and is eons more progressive than anything now is reactionary, then language has lost all meaning.</p>

<p>Repeat after me: settler America is a shithole!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes Minecraft is symbolic in many ways with The book of Revelation in the Bible and is preparing Us for the End-times war. Whether you want to believe it or not the facts are undeniable and the similarities are tantamount to the fact this game was divinely created through the hand spiritually. The Creator of this game goes by the name of Notch and in Jewish Gematria that equals = 201 and Roman in Jewish Gematria also equals = 201 same goes for with Apollo and what does that mean, you tell me.</p>

<p>The Ender Dragon represent Revelation 12 The Woman and the Dragon.</p>

<p>The Pig Men represents the Demon Legion of Revelation 9</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The locusts were not given power to kill them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see this in the game because Pig Men don&#39;t attack the player unless the Player Attacks the Pig Men and because they are Legion you attack one you are forced to fight them all.</p>

<p>The Golden Swords the Pig men have represents how the locust has this connection with Gold Crowns.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wither represents the beast from the bottomless pit in revelation 9 and the three unclean spirits in revelation 16</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were ruled by a king, the angel of the Abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek it is Apollyon. </p>

<p>And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouths of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not a coincidence that the Wither Has three mouths.</p>

<p>I&#39;m barley even scratching the Surface here with all these profound connections, And the only reason why I&#39;m writing this here is because of Minecraft 10th birthday. Other then that this is just too deep for most people to understand because your eyes are still in the Dream so I&#39;m going to end it here. One day everyone will see</p>
