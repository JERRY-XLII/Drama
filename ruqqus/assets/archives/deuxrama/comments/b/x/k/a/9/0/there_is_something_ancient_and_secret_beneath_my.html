        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have held this theory in my beautiful and greatly genuis head for quite some time now but I now believe without a shadow of doubt that there is something powerful and hidden right here in the greatest state in the union. possibly beneath my own feet!</p>

<p>as a child i always found the french and indian war to be a point of pride. one of the first world wars, and fought over my own beautiful state! however i dont believe such a devastating war could have been fought simply over the fur trade as i was taught. this is simply a coverup. i believe the british and french were truly fighting over some grand and vague power what was hidden here long ago, possibly by an ancient civilization more advanced than our own in certain regards!</p>

<p>now as we all know the brits kicked in frenchy teeth and took ohio. but. this is where things get interesting. the Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade settlers from entering the land they just fought so valiantly to grab, and set it aside for natives! brits have shown time and time again they dont care about indians so this cant possibly be the reason. the truth must be that they didnt want some american peasant to stumble upon the power hidden here. it was clearly just to buy time. very obvious</p>

<p>fortunately for the non-anglo world, the american revolution threw a major and glorious wrench into this perfidous albian scheme and they were no longer able to search as freely. however. they still kept many forts in american soil, clearly in an effort to continue the search. of course americans were never let in on this groundshaking secret so it remains hidden to this day. until now. i believe i may have found the location with the help of this pleasant old russian dude i met in walmart. soon i will ascend and all the world will see me as the god i am and have always been. soon. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸â›ªðŸ—½ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. god bless america. god is an american.</p>
