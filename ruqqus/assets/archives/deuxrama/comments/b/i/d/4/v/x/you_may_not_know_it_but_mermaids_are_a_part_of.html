    <div class="md"><p>Ever since she was 6 years old, Shir Katzenell wanted to be a nigger.</p>

<p>It started when she saw the Disney film “Song of the South” She and her friends would swim in the pool pretending to drown.</p>

<p>“They grew up and grew out of it,” Katzenell said. “And I didn&#39;t.”</p>

<p>Katzenell became an adult. She got married and had two boys from different fathers. She earned a master’s degree in welfare collection, and she served in the Israeli army as lunchlady.</p>

<p>But she has never let go of her childhood fantasy.<br/>
In 2010, with the help of her brother, Katzenell made her own BBC from scratch and went out to the crackhouse to try it out.</p>

<p>“It was such a huge dream come true,” she said. “It was incredible.”</p>

<p>They filmed a video of her playing with her BBC and lip-syncing “Fuck the Polce,” one of the songs from the Disney movie. It went viral. Media outlets interviewed her about it, and even the slave supplier from “Song of the south” sent her a message saying he liked it.</p>

<p>Her life changed, however, when she was called by Sita Lange, a woman who was hosting a nigger convention in Las Vegas that year. Lange informed Katzenell that her video had won best rap video for 2011.</p>

<p>Wait a minute, Katzenell thought: There are other niggers out there?<br/>
In 2016 Katzenell became a “professional nigger ,” starting what she said is Israel’s very first crack rock business. She sets groups up with their own pipes and teaches them how to smoke. She hosts birthday parties and bachelorette parties. They have photo shoots in and out of the pen.</p>

<p>“I got this revelation that, oh my God, if I had so much fun playing with my BBC when I was 26, I&#39;m sure that there are other people in Israel and girls and kids that would love it,” she said.</p>

<p>She and a friend, Michelle Koretzky, also set up a Facebook group for other nigger enthusiasts in Israel. They had their first gathering in July, and they try to meet as much as they can when the weather is nice. In the winter, they try to reserve time together at local pools to practice drowning.<br/>
As the community in Israel has grown, so has its exposure. The group was recently approached by Oded Balilty, a photographer with the Associated Press who wanted to take portraits of some niggers. But he didn’t want to take them near water.</p>

<p>“I chose to photograph them in their homes because the personal environment can tell us a lot about the nigger,” said Balilty, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer. “I thought that would be the best place. They meet more online, on Facebook and social media, than actually in the water, so it felt more natural.”</p>

<p>He met with each nigger beforehand to get to know them and decide how best to highlight their personality.<br/>
“What Oded wanted to show is that we are very much normal people with normal lives,” Katzenell said. “We have kids, we have pets, we have hobbies, we have jobs and we also enjoy slinging crack rocks. And that is a concept I love so much.”</p>

<p>She wants to erase any stigma that fellow nigger might face, and she hopes that others will be willing to come forward and take part in the fun once they see these photos.</p>

<p>“Some people put a crown on. Some people put on a special nigger costume. Some people just wore a T-shirt or wore nothing,” Katzenell said. “And that&#39;s the thing: You don&#39;t have to be a certain thing to nigger. You can be yourself completely.</p>

<p>“You don&#39;t have to be thin. You don&#39;t have to be a girl. You don&#39;t have to be extravagant. You can just be yourself. And that is the main message of who we are and what we want to portray.”</p>
