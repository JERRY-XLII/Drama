    <div class="md"><p>oh shit it was. Me and this super hot (I&#39;m lying, she was maybe a 7) German backpacker hooked up one night and made plans to go hiking in Victoria North of Melbourne, we had breakfast then drove up to Warangal? National park and started walking up a hiking path until we came to a stream, once we hit the stream we left the path to walk along the waterway, about 300ish metres along the stream we came to a deeper slower moving part of the stream and seen the Platy foraging around in the pebbles of the shallow areas next to the stream. We watched for like 15 minutes until he swam further away where it was to over grown to follow, it was magical.</p>
