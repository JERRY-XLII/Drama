    <div class="md"><p>Moviebob is unironically my favorite lolcow on the internet. Here are some highlights of the wonderful things Bob has said/done in the ~15 years he&#39;s been operating under that moniker:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The popularity of modern warfare shooters is a government psyop to turn American nerds against Hillary Clinton (he has believed this since 2012, pre-GamerGate and pre-Trump)</p></li>
<li><p>The Moon must be colonized and repurposed to replace most of Earth&#39;s agriculture (he never says what the land currently used for such purposes becomes)</p></li>
<li><p>The 90&#39;s console wars were his &quot;Vietnam&quot; and <em>Masters of the Universe</em> was his <em>Platoon</em> (in the sense it&#39;s a movie his hypothetical kids would have to watch to understand him, I guess his dad served?)</p></li>
<li><p>The Wizard film revealing Super Mario Bros 3 (his favorite video game) was as important as the JFK assassination</p></li>
<li><p>He skipped on his grandmother&#39;s funeral to go buy an air conditioner and as a grown-ass man would frequently loiter in his car playing gameboy until the rest of his family went to sleep so he could &quot;make videos in peace&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>That Shigeru Miyamoto has personally assigned him (in a dream, of course), the task of saving video gaming from the jocks invading the hobby, and if he succeeds, he will get to meet Mario at last. This is part of why he&#39;s so invested in Mario originally being from Brooklyn, and why he said that Yoshi&#39;s Island declaring all the games took place in the Mushroom Kingdom and the Brooklyn origin story was non-canon &quot;broke my brain&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of those come from <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/products/super-mario-bros-3-brick-by-brick">his book</a>, which sells itself as a deep-dive critical/academic analysis of Super Mario Bros 3, but, in reality is an incredibly over-sharing autobiography centered around his lifelong relationship with a fictional character in a game for children.</p>
