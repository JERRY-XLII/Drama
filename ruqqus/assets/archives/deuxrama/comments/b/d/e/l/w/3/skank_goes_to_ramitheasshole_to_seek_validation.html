    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s some dessert</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You’re saying that like she was in the same mindset as when she was dating her ex; I can speak from personal experience that someone complimenting you and calling you flirtatious names when you’re vulnerable, already feeling shitty and have a “fuck it” mentality after something like a breakup, you can do a loooooot of stuff you’d have never done before. It changed my sexuality all together.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the co worker knew exactly what he was doing and took advantage of the situation. He’s TA here, because he didn’t even try to console her emotionally, just “wow that sucks. youre so hot and beautiful, let’s go have sex in my car”.</p>

<p>OP’s ex doesn’t have dibs on her virginity. I’m a young adult male, and even I can see the value in seeing through sex and sticking with someone that you actually care about, in order to have a happy future. Maybe he could’ve tried talking more about why she didn’t feel ready(trust issues, traumatic experience, etc...) vs saying “I’m not satisfied, I’m out” and then taking offense when she made a mistake(she clearly regrets it). If her ex broke up bc he didn’t feel sexually satisfied, fuck that metaphorically. Yeah it sucks but guys can fucking wait to have sex, it’s not always a necessity, but a want.</p>

<p>In short, OP’s want for abstinence and waiting for the right time(a very hard choice to make for yourself especially with a long term BF and pressure from them) was overpowered by his penis. He took a chunk of her when he left(confidence in her own choices) , and she was borderline taken advantage AND ON TOP OF THAT HER WHOLE SOCIAL CIRCLE IS TURNING AGAINST HER. Are you fucking kidding me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s clearly the real issue here, the ex just wanted the notch in his belt, not a sexual relationship with his long-time loving girlfriend.</p>

<p>Imagine breaking up with someone because they&#39;re a picky eater and you want to be more adventurous, maybe go to a nice sushi place every now and then. Then you find out they were chowing down on gas station sushi with their scummiest co-worker just three days later. There&#39;s no way that wouldn&#39;t hurt.</p>

<p>How about wanting to get back together with the knowledge that she still wanted to wait? Should he have been proud and happy that she jumped on the first dude who said nice things to her? Like, duh, of course she can do whatever she wants but that shit is ice cold. He probably should have told their mutual friends to accept the hobo she found under a bridge as the new third in their relationship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man, I think u/tsavoy004 makes some good points.</p>

<p>First of all, the co-worker who tried to have sex with a single adult female by complimenting her is the real asshole here. He obviously should have offered himself up as her new doormat, now that she got rid of her old one, rather than pursue his sexual desire with a consenting acquaintance.</p>

<p>Second, the boyfriend should have been more patient and communicative with her. After waiting a measly 2.5 years while constantly reafirming his love and his desire for sexual intimacy, he obviously didn&#39;t consider her feelings enough. I bet he never even considered the trauma his very mature and ammicable break-up would cause HER.</p>

<p>After all,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But once Chad whispers the right pleasentries into their ear, women just need to get that cock. It&#39;s not always a want, but a neccessity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that was basically my point that I don’t think a lot of people understood; yea it sucks he didn’t get to take her virginity with someone he loved after jumping ship, BUT she was likely an emotional train wreck being fed verbal treats during an extremely vulnerable time.  Coworker is a piece of garbage since he new what he was doing when he started laying on the compliments knowing she was single.<br/>
Most were siding with ex bf bc he missed out, but she got absolutely shit on in every part of this situation.  But that doesn’t matter, cause he’s sad now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no you can all fuck right off the whole thread was bandwagoning the “fuck this skank” attitude and completely overlooking where she was mentally in the situation.  She was made to feel worthless by her bf after being dumped for her abstinence, and then her coworker piece of shit takes that opportunity to get an easy lay from someone grieving and regretting a lot of decisions.  </p>

<p>Do you really think he didn’t love her bf back that way he did?</p>

<p>Do you really think she was just itching for a chance to bone some rando after 2.5 years?  </p>

<p>Do you really think she was having a good time after her breakup?</p>

<p>Her now ex didn’t even come back to talk it all out, got all pissy bc he missed out after making the call to dump her bc “he has needs”(fuck that, myself and other adults have gone hella longer without sex quit being a bitch) and decided to completely shit his ex and then everyone against her.  </p>

<p>Everyone’s done things they’ve regretted in hindsight because of it being “in the moment” and didn’t have mental clarity.  She didn’t silly billy asked him to bone, he coerced it.  And yeah, it’s sucks for her ex.  He put a lot into the relationship, but his end goal here was mostly sex.  He destroyed her values, and got pissy when she had a change of heart and fucked up.  </p>

<p>I’ll defend this one to the end, I’ve reread the post and comments multiple times and don’t see anything differentl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but it&#39;s an opinion the vast majority of people share. (I forgot to mention asexuals, they wouldn&#39;t have to be in either category).</p>

<p>Relationships require sex if a participant is sexually interested and it&#39;s physically possible. Neglecting that creates a dysfunctional relationship, and that is not the fault of the involuntarily celibate participant</p>

<p>But that&#39;s what it was, a celibate relationship. OPs ex has every right to be mad about that.</p>

<p>What do you mean? I&#39;m commenting for the same reason everyone else does, because I wish to discuss it.</p>

<p>I’ve been so involved with both those threads I really don’t feel like discussing it anymore.  My mind hasn’t and probably won’t change, and I’ve  said all I got.  </p>

<p>got all pissy bc he missed out after making the call to dump her bc “he has needs”(fuck that, myself and other adults have gone hella longer without sex quit being a bitch)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I was talking about celibate relationships, and it was fair to assume you were saying it was ok to be in one, since many people are celibate outside of one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to change your whole point, just calling out the inconsistency here. Being celibate inside a relationship is very different from outside, and a person feeling negative about being in a dead bedroom should not be ridiculed for that negativity. It&#39;s natural and expected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He put a lot into the relationship, but his end goal here was mostly sex. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also projection. If his end goal was mostly sex, he likely would have broke up much earlier, and definitely wouldn&#39;t have asked her back and accepted her not being ready, so I&#39;m not sure how you could have honestly thought his main goal was sex if you &quot;reread the post and comments multiple times &quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My argument wasn’t how he sucked for what he wanted; it was how she was told by his actions that what she stood for didn’t matter for shit.  So her mind was likely not in a good place and co worker of hers seemingly capitalized on that.  Co worker knew damn well what he was doing, nobody tries to console a grieving person by fucking them and taking their virginity.  </p>

<p>I mentioned not needing sex, because as a single person, I don’t need to pursue sex with every woman I meet who’s also single.</p>

<p>I’d bet millions of people feel the same, wanting to wait until a certain milestone with a partner before giving up what’s theirs.  </p>

<p>Everyone sucked, but nobody thought the men were in the wrong, which I slightly disagreed with</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s reasonable for her to see it that way, but idt that&#39;s how he actually felt. She wasn&#39;t waiting for anything particular like marriage, she just didn&#39;t feel ready (which is completely fine), and he was reaching his breaking point when feeling like she might never feel ready, or just not with him.</p>

<p>Similarly, it would be reasonable for him to see it as her not finding him attractive, through her actions. I don&#39;t think he did anything wrong, until perhaps when he retaliated after she told him what she did. I can&#39;t see what I would have done differently in his place, until that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s an asshole for telling him about it and even trying to get back with him. She should have realized he&#39;d be hurt by it and wouldn&#39;t take her back.</p>

<p>Or maybe she should have broken up way earlier, when she realized she wasn&#39;t attracted to him. But I find it hard to blame her for that. It&#39;s easy to be inattentive or self-deluded, especially at that age.</p>
