<p>E.G I told her I cannot wash my lower body without an aid, and have a bathboard installed from my council (2 points). She wrote that her falsified perfect physical assessment disproves this, so 0 points. She did that in every category regardless of what I or my medical history says.</p>

<p>I cannot socialize or talk to people at all without psychological distress (8 points). She wrote that I talked to her fine in the assessment so 0 points.</p>

<p>I lack motivation to get dressed at home, and need to use aids to put my shoes on (each worth 2 points, so only one applies). She wrote that I was able to put my coat and hat on fine at the end of the assessment so 0 points.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember to take my medication on more than 50% of days, proven by the dates of my repeat prescription (1 point). She wrote that I&#39;m a good historian and could recall all my medical history so 0 points.</p>

<p>Also she wrote that I didn&#39;t look tired or in pain, so apparently I&#39;m lying about chronic fatigue and pain in most of my joints, both of which are already diagnosed by specialists, and more shit like that.</p>

<p>She wrote that I was well kempt, appeared well and in good health. I took a selfie and two videos of myself at the assessment centre and I had over 6 months of untrimmed, ungroomed beard growth, and you&#39;ve likely already seen my photos of my disgusting hair that hasn&#39;t been cut in over a decade and is rarely washed because of my overwhelming anxiety and lack of motivation from depression.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve proven she was lying about the whole lot and written and sent plenty of evidence for both a mandatory reconsideration and to the health assessment services with enough proof that she should be sacked, but in most cases they won&#39;t care, let the assessors get away with this, and don&#39;t do anything in the reconsideration and you then have to appeal and waitt over 12 months to challenge it in court, during which loads of disabled people just end up killing themselves.</p>

<p>This is what now happens in literally all such health assessments for benefits in the UK, and you get nothing until your court appeal date, in which over 70% of 0 point decisions are overturned and benefits awarded and backdated, proving how broken the system is. The main issue then is how to survive for 12-18 months until my court appeal?</p>
