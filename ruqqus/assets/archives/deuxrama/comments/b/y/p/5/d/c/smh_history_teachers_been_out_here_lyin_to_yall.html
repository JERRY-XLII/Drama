    <div class="md"><p>America was literally founded on child rape (of brown kids of course!) and continues to do so, peaking in the 20th century by providing those damn savage yonguns to the largest child molestation ring in history.</p>

<p>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOUR ILLEGITIMATE, ILLEGAL BY YOUR OWN LAWS, SETTLER STATE IS. THIS IS NOT RECENT. THIS IS NOT A THING OF THE PAST. IT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED BECAUSE AMERICA IS INHERENTLY EVIL</p>

<p>America was a leader in all of that, before Columbus. Even in the worst cases, it was better off for everybody, but especially women and queers, before colonialism began to force us to change our savage ways. Now you celebrate those ways, but still are just an imitation.</p>

<p>People call me a reactionary for wanting to go back to pre-contact life. Pre-contact, my existence as a non-binary person would be respected, venerated even. My disability would be respected and I would be helped, not out of pity but that same respect and honest care, if I were unable to do something. I would have food and shelter and water, guaranteed. By birth and nothing else, I would have access to a means of production and countless hours of training, which was given to everybody indiscriminate of sex in even the most &quot;sexist&quot; of nations that I know of. In those most &quot;sexist&quot; nations, the only things women are excluded from are some ceremonies. They also have their own ceremonies. Versus now, where we are either excluded from work or simply paid less than the already despicably low pay of the average working class person. And this is just the damned surface.</p>

<p>If re-implementing a system that worked far better and is eons more progressive than anything now is reactionary, then language has lost all meaning.</p>

<p>Repeat after me: settler America is a shithole!</p>
