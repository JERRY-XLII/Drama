<p>I believe women are evil and that the gender of the devil is female.

<p>I asked my friend for a sip of his pepsi and he gave me the can. Afterward 
he accused me of &#39;nigger lipping&#39; his pepsi and refused to take it back. In 
a rage, I filed a hate crime report with the NYPD and had his racist ass 
hauled off to juvee where I&#39;m sure disgusting faggots are anally violating 
him even as I type these words. I abhor bigots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snappy quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>America was literally founded on child rape (of brown kids of course!) and continues to do so, peaking in the 20th century by providing those damn savage yonguns to the largest child molestation ring in history.</p>

<p>THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOUR ILLEGITIMATE, ILLEGAL BY YOUR OWN LAWS, SETTLER STATE IS. THIS IS NOT RECENT. THIS IS NOT A THING OF THE PAST. IT HAS ALWAYS EXISTED BECAUSE AMERICA IS INHERENTLY EVIL</p>

<p>America was a leader in all of that, before Columbus. Even in the worst cases, it was better off for everybody, but especially women and queers, before colonialism began to force us to change our savage ways. Now you celebrate those ways, but still are just an imitation.</p>

<p>People call me a reactionary for wanting to go back to pre-contact life. Pre-contact, my existence as a non-binary person would be respected, venerated even. My disability would be respected and I would be helped, not out of pity but that same respect and honest care, if I were unable to do something. I would have food and shelter and water, guaranteed. By birth and nothing else, I would have access to a means of production and countless hours of training, which was given to everybody indiscriminate of sex in even the most &quot;sexist&quot; of nations that I know of. In those most &quot;sexist&quot; nations, the only things women are excluded from are some ceremonies. They also have their own ceremonies. Versus now, where we are either excluded from work or simply paid less than the already despicably low pay of the average working class person. And this is just the damned surface.</p>

<p>If re-implementing a system that worked far better and is eons more progressive than anything now is reactionary, then language has lost all meaning.</p>

<p>Repeat after me: settler America is a shithole!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pre ww2, socialists in germany totally tanked the economy. Then they made a scapegoat out of jewish people by releasing propaganda that changed the publics perception of jewish people.</p>

<p>A half decade later, when the gas chambers were in full use, nobody cared about the atrocities of the genocide because they were conditioned to blame the poor living standards on jewish people. The genocide was actually encouraged because of how many german people were upset with their countries health, they saw it as the solution to their problems.</p>

<p>I wonder what the political conversation around the white race is going to look like in 5 years. If marxists can maintain this status quo of isolating white people from the rest of society, something similar to the holocaust is liable to happen again.</p>

<p>Will the anti-white movement be able to organize themselves as well as the german nazis to carry out a genocide? Absolutely not, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that they would if they could.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to stop cultural marxism from spreading. My peers are too affluent. I&#39;m just perceived as some alt-right bigot whenever I speak about it.</p>

<p>All I can really do is show people what I see and explain it to them peacefully. My example is what will break their conditioning. When things are going even more to shit, my tune will stay the same, and hopefully my resolve will convert others to looking at things the way I do.</p>

<p>Zombies: Represent the bugman. Slow, stupid, and outnumber Steve by 100 to 1. They have no ulterior motives beyond consumption.</p>

<p>Creepers: Represent muslims. Not only do they blow themselves up but they are also green which is a color strongly associated with Islam.</p>

<p>Enderman: A tall black man who steals shit and can&#39;t swim</p>

<p>Your words hurt my feelings, and for the safety of my well being I am going to report you. I do not want to hear that alt-right rhetoric. We censor people because it is the right thing to do. TO protect people from evil bigots like you who think we have to counter peoples points. I can&#39;t be bothered to logically counter someones stance on things when my feelings are hurt. MY feelings trump all other actions and i just can&#39;t even. Clearly you are on the wrong side of history or else what you say wouldn&#39;t be censored. Freaking racist like you make me so mad. I know you didn&#39;t even mention race but I know your one of those racist because you are blaming us for censoring you when we just simply don&#39;t do that. Your words censor you not us. Now get out of my safe space nazi.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did add the quotes, and many more. I think it&#39;s something going on with Snappy as he&#39;s also not using quotes on some other subs where he should normally be such as SRD. </p>

<p>I sent u/justcool393 a message about it, but JC didn&#39;t see anything immediately wrong and will look into it later when less busy.</p>

<p>Be patient :)</p>
