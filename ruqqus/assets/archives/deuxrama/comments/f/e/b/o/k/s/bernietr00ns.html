    <div class="md"><p>Fun fact: the hood rat in the far bottom right is <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2015/04/01/us/anthony-stokes-heart-transplant-death/index.html">Anthony Stokes</a>, a kid who was initially denied a heart transplant at 13 because he wasn&#39;t taking his medicine. His family raised a huge national media firestorm by claiming he was rejected due to racism and that the doctor had cited Anthony&#39;s time in Juvenile Detention and low grades as a reason for lowering his position on the transplant list. As a result of all the manufactured outcry, Anthony was moved immediately to the top of the list and quickly received a heart transplant.</p>

<p>At age 15, Anthony died after &quot;carjacking someone, burglarizing a home, shooting at an elderly woman, leading police on a high speed chase and then dying after his car hit a pole.&quot; That scumfuck blew a decade or more of life that could have gone to someone good because his momma cried racism to the national media and the transplant list was too fucking cowardly to stand their ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I‚Äôve noticed there is a lot of people who are extremely insecure about their height, and I think it‚Äôs insane!</p>

<p>I believe short men are much more attractive than tall men. I believe around 5‚Äô and 5‚Äô5 is the perfect height for men.</p>

<p>For instance, the shorter you are, the easier you are to pick up and have anal sex. Guys who are tall usually weigh a lot more, and are harder to adjust it properly. In my experience men who are short also tend to be cuter than taller men, though that‚Äôs not a fact, it just happens more often that I see a cute small guy.</p>

<p>The weight is a major benefit, the fact that you can be 110 lbs without being super skinny is awesome. I can appreciate a man who is in shape but isn‚Äôt going to break my back trying to lift.</p>

<p>In conclusion, be happy about your height</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I‚Äôm really glad you either have parents who are supporting your health insurance financially, or a job that is, and I hope for your sake that that never changes. Hopefully you never join the group of people who were once ‚Äúso happy‚Äù with their great health insurance plan until they got a chronic illness that made them unable to work, got fired, struggled to pay COBRA for a while, and then either declared bankruptcy or died.</p>

<p>I volunteer at an organization that offers free medical care every year. Over 5,000 people showed up last time. People who lined up at 2am got seen at 4pm. It felt like being in a third world country. Give me an imperfect Canadian or European system any day of the week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic, where are all of the other politicians with these great healthcare reform policies that aren‚Äôt complete lies? </p>

<p>Obama campaigned on a platform that included Medicare for all who wanted it, aka a ‚Äúpublic option‚Äù. The very first thing he did when it came time to figure out the ACA was to toss out all of the people out of the discussions who had campaigned for him <em>with the explicit understanding that M4A would be on the table</em> and allow members of the insurance and healthcare industries to write the bill. His administration didn‚Äôt even bother using the public option as a bargaining chip. It was instantly discarded. He did a lot of other unbelievably horrific things while in office but this was one of the first. </p>

<p>So please tell me about the candidates who have plans to fix healthcare and meaningfully offer a public option and are not just using it as a way to get votes. Even Andrew Yang, if you actually took the time to read his page on ‚ÄùMedicare for all‚Äùwas lying through his teeth and completely abusing the term. </p>

<p>Literally every candidate that I have ever seen has been willing to throw the poor and the middle class people who work hard and want to afford their lifesaving medications under the bus. Who else can you honestly say gives a fuck and isn‚Äôt putting forth a plan they either know will not work (Medicare for all who want it), or no plan, or even to roll back the extremely minimal gains made after 2008?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don‚Äôt need free shit, I have plenty of money and am self sufficient. What I definitely do NOT need is an expensive illness wiping out my life savings, with that money going to BS like $10 throat lozenges. Have you done much research into the reality for people who don‚Äôt have financial access to reasonable health care here in the US? Or you don‚Äôt care if they fucked because god forbid a single illegal immigrant gets a handout. You‚Äôd rather cut off your own leg than help someone who hasn‚Äôt earned it. Meanwhile the people on top don‚Äôt even bother to laugh at you because your existence and the existence of your family (and entire social class) is literally never considered by them for a single iota .</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want open borders, I think it is incredibly dangerous. But you‚Äôre willing to fuck over your neighbors who are having to beg for money on gofundme for insulin because omg a brown person might get in. Why don‚Äôt you support massive fines for businesses that hire illegal immigrants? The illegal immigration would cease immediately. But it‚Äôs easier to blame desperate poor people</p>

<p>As a site note, I found a bit of drama from 5 months ago while searching for this.</p>

<p>Apparently Sangled, the creator of this particular picrew, doesn&#39;t believe asexuals to be valid members of the LGBT community, which caused trannies to have a meltodown and start removing his watermark from the pfp, as well a ignating a very civilized argument over &quot;aphobia&quot;.
Y&#39;know, eating their own n sheit.</p>

Hopefully you never join the group of people who were once ‚Äúso happy‚Äù with their great health insurance plan until they got a chronic illness that made them unable to work, got fired, struggled to pay COBRA for a while, and then either declared bankruptcy or died.</p>

<p>I volunteer at an organization that offers free medical care every year. Over 5,000 people showed up last time. People who lined up at 2am got seen at 4pm. It felt like being in a third world country. Give me an imperfect Canadian or European system any day of the week.</p>
