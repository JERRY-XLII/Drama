    <div class="md"><p>Its kinda funny, cause reddit was practically founded by contrarian losers on the spectrum. Youd think it would be obvious that such people would only be more motivated to keep going when told to leave</p>

<p>On a more serious note, has reddit ever banned a sub as big as GRU before? Didnt they have like 250,000 subscribers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Powerjannies and Reddit administration are having trouble coping with the sudden realization that updooterinos don’t translate to real votes and they’re just lashing out blindly in a desperate bid to avoid having to acknowledge that Reddit has collective political clout equivalent to a homeless man shouting on a streetcorner. Less, actually, because R*dditor 🤢 culture actively drives real people away from the associated politick.</p>

<p>Not sure how many GRU had and I’m too lazy to Wayback Machine it rn. CA and MDE were huge though. I think CA was larger? But we were quarantined for way too long and I have no idea what the member count was anywhere near the end. This is somewhere in the top 3 for sure tho and it’s only going to hurt their bottom line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, that place is awful! Found them quoting and tagging you there. Also, looks like you responded but they deleted your comments? Seriously, ignore that place. It looks like they just enjoy dumping on things that people enjoy, which is all manner of sad...</p>

<p>Honestly I had no idea that sub existed, apparently neither did she. Then they tagged her over there and... lolcow? Is a thing. It&#39;s a person they &quot;milk for lols&quot;; don&#39;t ask...</p>

<p>It is way, way, way more toxic than her edit. I think she just edited her post to address her own confusion as to why a group of emotionally stunted folks would do that... but, hey, it&#39;s the internet. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
