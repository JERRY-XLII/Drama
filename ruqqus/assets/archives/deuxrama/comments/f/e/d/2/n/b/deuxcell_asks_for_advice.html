    <div class="md"><p>I have used services of hookers several times in the past</p>

<p>Only the most vile of men who cannot get laid any means necessary do that, yikes.</p>

<p>No feelings, just a strait forward transaction.</p>

<p>I bet for the &quot;e-girl&quot; is also a straight forward transaction, why are you bitter that she won&#39;t fall in love with you?</p>

<p>I was deluded into thinking their was something between us.</p>

<p>Your delusions are your problem and making bad financial decisions based on them is 100% your fault.</p>

<p>She is even more cold and unwilling to engage with me than ever before, basically refusing to even converse, to actually perform a service to which she has been ridiculously overpaid</p>

<p>If a service is a rip off, STOP PAYING FOR IT. As for being unwilling to converse with you, I am shocked. Everyone knows that the definition of a Chad is unemployed John with no car at his mom&#39;s basement.</p>

<p>The thing is, I am reluctant to break away because I always feel like I have unfinished business with this girl, which is why I keep returning.</p>

<p>The only unfinished business is her calling the police or leaking all your shit to your family, but hey, keep returning, who wouldn&#39;t want closure decorated with a restraining order?</p>

<p>She had my real name and the danger was there</p>

<p>Even my niece who is 9 knows that she shouldn&#39;t give her real name to strangers. smh</p>

<p>I used a fake name and tried to cover my tracks but she saw right through it</p>

<p>STALKER CONFIRMED.</p>

<p>OP you are beyond lame and you need mental help asap. That&#39;s not addiction. That&#39;s predatory behavior. It&#39;s like putting whipped cream on dog shit. You are stalking a sex worker, insulting her and keep returning with excuses about some imaginary connection.</p>

<p>You are mentally disturbed. See a psychiatrist because you need medication and therapy.</p>

<p>Is it surprising that she was neither the least bit surprised or angry and merely charged me an exorbitant fee to be unblocked?</p>

<p>If there is a job where I get paid to unblock people, sign me up. Why wouldn&#39;t she do it since u act retarded?</p>

Sorry, it&#39;s just that all my coworkers are getting married and I&#39;m starting to feel left out. You don&#39;t want to marry me? So basically all I am is a wallet to you?!</p>
