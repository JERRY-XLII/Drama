    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why...</p>

<p>A <strong>cuckold</strong> is the husband of an adulterous wife. In evolutionary biology, the term is also applied to males who are unwittingly investing parental effort in offspring that are not genetically their own.</p>

<p>In Western traditions, cuckolds have sometimes been described as &quot;wearing the horns of a cuckold&quot; or just &quot;wearing the horns&quot;. This is an allusion to the mating habits of stags, who forfeit their mates when they are defeated by another male. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a> (especially in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Italy">Southern Italy</a>, where it is a major personal offence), the insult is often accompanied by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_of_the_horns">sign of the horns</a>. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">French</a>, the term is &quot;<em>porter des cornes</em>&quot;, which is used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moli%C3%A8re">Moli√®re</a> to describe someone whose consort has been unfaithful. In German, the term is &quot;<em>jemandem H√∂rner aufsetzen</em>&quot;, or &quot;<em>H√∂rner tragen</em>&quot;, the husband is &quot;<em>der geh√∂rnte Ehemann</em>&quot;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Rabelais">Rabelais</a> wrote the <em>Tiers Livers</em> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargantua_and_Pantagruel">Gargantua and Pantagruel</a> in 1546, by which time the symbol of the horns was &quot;so well-known and over-used that the author could barely avoid making reference to it&quot;.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckold#cite_note-9">[9]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moli%C3%A8re">Moli√®re</a>&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_for_Wives"><em>L&#39;√âcole des femmes</em></a> (1662) is the story of a man who mocks cuckolds and becomes one at the end. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_Tales"><em>Canterbury Tales</em></a> (c.¬†1372‚Äì77), &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miller%27s_Tale">The Miller&#39;s Tale</a>&quot; is a story that humorously examines the life of a cuckold. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language">Chinese</a> usage, an altogether different allusion is used, when the cuckold (or wittol) is said to be &quot;<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%88%B4%E7%B6%A0%E5%B8%BD%E5%AD%90">Êà¥Á∂†Â∏ΩÂ≠ê</a>&quot; (wearing the green hat), which derives from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law">sumptuary laws</a> used in China from the 13th to the 18th centuries that required the males in households with prostitutes to wrap their heads in a green scarf (or later a hat).</p>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation">abbreviation</a> of <em>cuckold</em>, the term <em>cuck</em> has been used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">alt-right</a> to attack the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity">masculinity</a> of an opponent. It was originally aimed at other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism">conservatives</a>, whom the alt-right saw as ineffective.</p>

<p>Unlike the traditional definition of the term, in fetish usage a <strong>cuckold</strong> or <strong>wife watching</strong> is complicit in their partner&#39;s sexual &quot;infidelity&quot;; the wife who enjoys <em>cuckolding</em> her husband is called a <strong>cuckoldress</strong> if the man is more submissive.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckold#cite_note-12">[12]</a>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources"><em>page¬†needed</em></a>]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckold#cite_note-13">[13]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckold#cite_note-14">[14]</a> If a couple can keep the fantasy in the bedroom, or come to an agreement where being cuckolded in reality does not damage the relationship, they may try it out in reality. However, the primary proponent of the fantasy is almost always the one being humiliated, or the &quot;cuckold&quot;: the cuckold convinces his lover to participate in the fantasy for them, though other &quot;cuckolds&quot; may prefer their lover to initiate the situation instead. The fetish fantasy does not work at all if the cuckold is being humiliated against their will.</p>

<p>Psychology regards cuckold fetishism as a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadomasochism">masochism</a>, the cuckold deriving pleasure from being humiliated. In Freudian analysis, cuckold fetishism is the eroticization of the fears of infidelity and of failure in the man&#39;s competition for procreation and the affection of females. In his book <em>Masochism and the Self,</em> psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Baumeister">Roy Baumeister</a> advanced a <em>Self Theory</em> analysis that cuckolding (or specifically, all masochism) was a form of escaping from self-awareness, at times when self-awareness becomes burdensome, such as with perceived inadequacy. According to this theory, the physical or mental pain from masochism brings attention away from the self, which would be desirable in times of &quot;guilt, anxiety, or insecurity&quot;, or at other times when self-awareness is unpleasant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean it is capitalism. Capitalism doesn&#39;t care about shame or morality or any of that shit. There is only one question you have to answer. To succeed in a capitalist system all you have to do is to provide a service other people will pay for. He made a youtube channel and made millions of money, and her girlfriend is gonna make bank, the drama around it was such a big advertisment for her onlyfans account, so you can cry and call him a simp or a cuck and call her a whore or whatever, the invisible hand of the market favors them and made them succesful. The hand simply doesn&#39;t give a fuck how modest your girlfriend is or how moral you are, the hand is gonna punch you with debt and even homelessness, if you can&#39;t give it what it wants. If you don&#39;t like it maybe seize the means of production and try to start a communist revolution.</p>

<p>Yes for Western Europe and the coastal areas of North America <em>and practically nowhere else</em>, I mentioned that before. You have to remember that neither his audience (the ones doing the criticising), nor Ian, live in the areas where it is free of stigma</p>
