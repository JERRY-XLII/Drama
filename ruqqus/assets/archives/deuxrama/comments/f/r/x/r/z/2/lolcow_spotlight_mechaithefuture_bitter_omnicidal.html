Think of it as JFK&#39;s <em>Profiles in Courage</em>, but for a pathetic low-T gong fei</p>

<p>-----------------66</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.vn/QiAz6">(archive link in case he gets sitewide y&#39;alled)</a></p>

<p>Meet u/mechaithefuture, a bitter chinkcel loving in the Big Apple. He enjoys playing at being a day trader, and wishing he was a true mainland Chinese. The last few weeks, he&#39;s spent most of his free time sperging out on WSB about how many people he wants to to see die of Coronachan.</p>

<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fos1ja/big_short_investigation_on_unemployment/flh2jsl/?context=100">mechaithefuture thinks the Coronachan death rate is 68%.</a> [Or is it 40%?](reddit.com<a href="/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqw79k/update_trump_says_a_quarantine_of_the_new_york/fltzlby/">/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqw79k/update_trump_says_a_quarantine_of_the_new_york/fltzlby/</a>?context=100)When rightfully accused of retardation, he doubles down. Even better, he&#39;s excited about this because he believes glorious China&#39;s official numbers <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fos1ja/big_short_investigation_on_unemployment/flh48yq/?context=100">and thinks the virus is particularly deadly to mayos</a>.</p>

<p>[He hates darkies too.](reddit.com<a href="/r/aznidentity/comments/fnys3l/wtf_charges_dropped_against_suspect_in_attack_of/flcfjwz/">/r/aznidentity/comments/fnys3l/wtf_charges_dropped_against_suspect_in_attack_of/flcfjwz/</a>?context=100)</p>

<p>However, he&#39;s worried that the body count might not be as high as he hoped, [because China has betrayed their prodigal son by claiming to offer aid.](reddit.com<a href="/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqw79k/update_trump_says_a_quarantine_of_the_new_york/flxrbyd/">/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fqw79k/update_trump_says_a_quarantine_of_the_new_york/flxrbyd/</a>?context=3)</p>

<p>In these trying times, he would like to remind you not to believe the wh*te lies, because [snakebatpangolinflu didn&#39;t originate from China](reddit.com<a href="/r/Sino/comments/fngivc/why_i_dont_care_if_trump_calls_it_the_chinese/fl9oble/">/r/Sino/comments/fngivc/why_i_dont_care_if_trump_calls_it_the_chinese/fl9oble/</a>?context=100) </p>

<p>When he&#39;s not trying his hardest to get banned from his third favorite sub, u/mechaithefuture likes to spend time on his hobbies, chiefly acting like a pathetic </p>

<p>[He wishes those bitches in WMAFWMAF relationships would leave their Nordic studs to jump on his teenie weenie chopstick peenie.](reddit.com<a href="/r/aznidentity/comments/fny8yo/instagram_is_full_of_those_fakes_claiming_to_be/flcen2r/">/r/aznidentity/comments/fny8yo/instagram_is_full_of_those_fakes_claiming_to_be/flcen2r/</a>?context=100)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fhw4na/why_is_the_sub_encouraging_dont_dance/fkdoori/?context=100">¬†They&#39;re now saying [covid] was manufactured by the U.S. government to thwart China&#39;s economic growth.</a></p>

<p>[Its sad to say China is failing to learn from the negative influences of non-East Asian foreigners in Hong Kong and Tiananmen Square.¬†](reddit.com<a href="/r/Sino/comments/fc98sa/discussion_on_chinas_new_green_card_policy/fj9yl52/">/r/Sino/comments/fc98sa/discussion_on_chinas_new_green_card_policy/fj9yl52/</a>?context=100)</p>

<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/f0wdxh/this_attitudefinding_a_white_guy_to_be_with_shows/fh7b0u1/">Like I&#39;ve said before, when I see them around NYC, I view them like the homeless. I feel sorry for the AF in WMAF relationship, but it is her choice much like how many healthy able body homeless are in such a position as a byproduct of their choices.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fr4wd7/german_state_finance_minister_committed_suicide/flu7s1p/?context=100">Despite all the fake news about China lowering their numbers, in my opinion, it is Africa that is lowering their numbers.</a></p>

<p>Last week I saw a few WMAFs in the streets.</p>

<p>In Brooklyn, I saw AF Gold Diggers/Prostitutes with WM who had grey hair (50s-60s). They had normal cloths on, but you can obviously tell WTF was going on.</p>

<p>When I was in the subway, I saw a WM wearing a shirt and tie underneath his black coat with an AF who also dressed professionally - probably after a night out as it was Saturday. The couple seemed like they were both in their 40s-50s. She did not seem to care about the WM as she was focused on her phone sitting down on one of the benches in the 36th st train station while the WM was pacing around. They did not strike me as a happy couple.</p>

<p>In Manhattan, I saw a AF who seemed like she was in her early to mid 20s with a late 20s to early 30s WM who was at least 6&#39;4&quot;. The WM did not seem to actually care about what she was actually saying (can&#39;t blame him, obvious dude red pilling and just trying to get laid) while she tried to make herself seemed interesting.</p>

<p>Of all the WMAF couples I&#39;ve seen in NYC, I&#39;ve never seen one where I can say the AF seemed successful. Minus the ones who whore out their culture like Constance Wu and the Gold Digging Prostitutes, at best I can see the AF will maybe obtain a working class salary level job (~$60k). If they cannot value themselves to find someone who actually cares about them for who they are rather than a sex slave, I cannot see them valuing themselves to make a ROI of their time and skill in the current job market.</p>
