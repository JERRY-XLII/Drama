I&#39;m not even particularly strong and I work at least 8 hours a day in a physical trade and then lift after. You need to examine what you&#39;re doing with your body if you want to get stronger. Very few people pop out of the womb as athletes but if it&#39;s something you want you need to eat better and lift heavier, my King. I&#39;ll legit send you some resources on where to start if you want. I want all of my e-bros to be lifting like beasts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what&#39;s up brother, I&#39;m going to post this in this thread a few times. Sorry, been a bit busy these past few days. </p>

<p>To be straight up, there&#39;s no shortcut or secret trick to getting strong, unless you&#39;ve got the money and the willingness to play with your health and cycle certain Mexican supplements. That said, unless you&#39;re a professional athlete or you know a particularly talented swole chemist to guide you through the process I wouldn&#39;t recommend that. I&#39;ve never used anything other than protein supplements, occasionally a preworkout and creatine.</p>

<p>What trips most people up when they start lifting is that they don&#39;t progress as quickly as they want to or don&#39;t see noticeable aesthetic gains in the time period they think they should. Everyone is different, but if you&#39;re actually looking to get strong you&#39;ve got to be willing to stick with a program and depending on your diet and genetics it could take some time. It&#39;s also work, as in you&#39;ve got to be willing to hurt and sweat. You also need to be able to identify when pain is from an injury(act accordingly in terms of rehab) and when you&#39;re being a little bitch. Eventually you&#39;ll get so into it that you will want to disregard legitimate warning signs from your body, but don&#39;t. Check out channels like this and look for videos on form:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6TRaqsCQQBI0QF6aSBz4nw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6TRaqsCQQBI0QF6aSBz4nw</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what you need to do:</p>

<p>Take a look at yourself in the mirror and take note of what you want to change. Have someone moderately competent assist you in finding your max effort lifts in squat, bench and deadlift. Identify where you want to go from where you are. Once you&#39;ve done that it&#39;s time to pick a program. </p>

<p>Reddit is full of weak nerds who love Stronglifts 5x5 but to be honest there isn&#39;t much wrong with it, just don&#39;t stick with it past a year or so. Here&#39;s a link to the stronglifts website: <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">https://stronglifts.com/5x5/</a> </p>

<p>Additionally here&#39;s a link to the app which should assist you in keeping track of your progress and setting up/modifying your lifting sessions.  <a href="https://stronglifts.com/apps/#gref">https://stronglifts.com/apps/#gref</a> </p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s fascination with 5x5 aside, I&#39;ve always been more partial to Wendler&#39;s 5/3/1 program. You can read about that here:  <a href="https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner">https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an app that is free which I&#39;ve used in the past:  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/531-strength/id1062989244">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/531-strength/id1062989244</a> </p>

<p>Look at both of these programs and decide what you feel is best for you, but remember that you have to stick with it once you&#39;ve made your choice. A lot of people fuck up and hop from program to program without allowing any single program to work over the time needed. Once you&#39;re about a year or so into lifting you&#39;ll have enough strength and knowledge to serve as an adequate foundation when moving forward and selecting a more advanced program. </p>

<p>With both of the above programs you&#39;ll want to supplement with some accessory exercises, I&#39;d suggest both barbell and dumbell curls for aesthetics and farmers walks just for the added strength. ( <a href="https://www.t-nation.com/training/farmer-s-walk-cure">https://www.t-nation.com/training/farmer-s-walk-cure</a> )</p>

<p>Also, eat well. If you&#39;re looking to put on mass you&#39;ll want to eat at a caloric surplus. For the first few months that surplus won&#39;t matter as much as you&#39;ll get what are called noob gains regardless, but once you&#39;re in the thick of it you&#39;ll want to eat right. You should consume about 1.5-2 grams of protein per lb of body weight. At the end of the day consisting hitting your macros is more important than protein intake though. I won&#39;t go into much detail regarding nutrition as I am not a nutritionist and I eat like shit and drink on weekends. I will however link you this. Diet gets trickier the more niche your diet is, ie. vegan, paleo, carnivore, whatever- the overall rules remain the same though. </p>

<p><a href="https://stronglifts.com/nutrition/#gref">https://stronglifts.com/nutrition/#gref</a> </p>

<p>Basically, figure out what you want, pick a program, eat right and keep working. If you&#39;re in your 20s this should be easy and if you start lifting in your 20s you&#39;ll probably hit your peak in your mid 30s. </p>

<p>Now, I say all of this as someone who doesn&#39;t quite follow the rules and can often be found fucking around and not on program/eating correctly; I&#39;d be a lot stronger and better off if I ate better and stayed on a strict program.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to throw in a bit of cardio and maybe go on a distance run once a week.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to throw in a bit of cardio and maybe go on a distance run once a week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d add that you shouldn&#39;t focus on what a lot of people in the fitness community online have to say in regards to their workout plans or diet, a lot of them are on gear and won&#39;t admit it. You don&#39;t have to be on gear to get strong and look the part, but a lot of diets and the more complex plans you&#39;ll see touted on youtube are being run by dudes on crazy amounts of gear. Just stick to the basics for a bit and branch out as you see fit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to post this in this thread a few times. Sorry, been a bit busy these past few days. </p>

<p>To be straight up, there&#39;s no shortcut or secret trick to getting strong, unless you&#39;ve got the money and the willingness to play with your health and cycle certain Mexican supplements. That said, unless you&#39;re a professional athlete or you know a particularly talented swole chemist to guide you through the process I wouldn&#39;t recommend that. I&#39;ve never used anything other than protein supplements, occasionally a preworkout and creatine.</p>

<p>What trips most people up when they start lifting is that they don&#39;t progress as quickly as they want to or don&#39;t see noticeable aesthetic gains in the time period they think they should. Everyone is different, but if you&#39;re actually looking to get strong you&#39;ve got to be willing to stick with a program and depending on your diet and genetics it could take some time. It&#39;s also work, as in you&#39;ve got to be willing to hurt and sweat. You also need to be able to identify when pain is from an injury(act accordingly in terms of rehab) and when you&#39;re being a little bitch. Eventually you&#39;ll get so into it that you will want to disregard legitimate warning signs from your body, but don&#39;t. Check out channels like this and look for videos on form:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6TRaqsCQQBI0QF6aSBz4nw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6TRaqsCQQBI0QF6aSBz4nw</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what you need to do:</p>

<p>Take a look at yourself in the mirror and take note of what you want to change. Have someone moderately competent assist you in finding your max effort lifts in squat, bench and deadlift. Identify where you want to go from where you are. Once you&#39;ve done that it&#39;s time to pick a program. </p>

<p>Reddit is full of weak nerds who love Stronglifts 5x5 but to be honest there isn&#39;t much wrong with it, just don&#39;t stick with it past a year or so. Here&#39;s a link to the stronglifts website: <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">https://stronglifts.com/5x5/</a> </p>

<p>Additionally here&#39;s a link to the app which should assist you in keeping track of your progress and setting up/modifying your lifting sessions.  <a href="https://stronglifts.com/apps/#gref">https://stronglifts.com/apps/#gref</a> </p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s fascination with 5x5 aside, I&#39;ve always been more partial to Wendler&#39;s 5/3/1 program. You can read about that here:  <a href="https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner">https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an app that is free which I&#39;ve used in the past:  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/531-strength/id1062989244">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/531-strength/id1062989244</a> </p>

<p>Look at both of these programs and decide what you feel is best for you, but remember that you have to stick with it once you&#39;ve made your choice. A lot of people fuck up and hop from program to program without allowing any single program to work over the time needed. Once you&#39;re about a year or so into lifting you&#39;ll have enough strength and knowledge to serve as an adequate foundation when moving forward and selecting a more advanced program. </p>

<p>With both of the above programs you&#39;ll want to supplement with some accessory exercises, I&#39;d suggest both barbell and dumbell curls for aesthetics and farmers walks just for the added strength. ( <a href="https://www.t-nation.com/training/farmer-s-walk-cure">https://www.t-nation.com/training/farmer-s-walk-cure</a> )</p>

<p>Also, eat well. If you&#39;re looking to put on mass you&#39;ll want to eat at a caloric surplus. For the first few months that surplus won&#39;t matter as much as you&#39;ll get what are called noob gains regardless, but once you&#39;re in the thick of it you&#39;ll want to eat right. You should consume about 1.5-2 grams of protein per lb of body weight. At the end of the day consisting hitting your macros is more important than protein intake though. I won&#39;t go into much detail regarding nutrition as I am not a nutritionist and I eat like shit and drink on weekends. I will however link you this. Diet gets trickier the more niche your diet is, ie. vegan, paleo, carnivore, whatever- the overall rules remain the same though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>what&#39;s up brother, I&#39;m going to post this in this thread a few times. Sorry, been a bit busy these past few days. </p>

<p>To be straight up, there&#39;s no shortcut or secret trick to getting strong, unless you&#39;ve got the money and the willingness to play with your health and cycle certain Mexican supplements. That said, unless you&#39;re a professional athlete or you know a particularly talented swole chemist to guide you through the process I wouldn&#39;t recommend that. I&#39;ve never used anything other than protein supplements, occasionally a preworkout and creatine.</p>

<p>What trips most people up when they start lifting is that they don&#39;t progress as quickly as they want to or don&#39;t see noticeable aesthetic gains in the time period they think they should. Everyone is different, but if you&#39;re actually looking to get strong you&#39;ve got to be willing to stick with a program and depending on your diet and genetics it could take some time. It&#39;s also work, as in you&#39;ve got to be willing to hurt and sweat. You also need to be able to identify when pain is from an injury(act accordingly in terms of rehab) and when you&#39;re being a little bitch. Eventually you&#39;ll get so into it that you will want to disregard legitimate warning signs from your body, but don&#39;t. Check out channels like this and look for videos on form:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6TRaqsCQQBI0QF6aSBz4nw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6TRaqsCQQBI0QF6aSBz4nw</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what you need to do:</p>

<p>Take a look at yourself in the mirror and take note of what you want to change. Have someone moderately competent assist you in finding your max effort lifts in squat, bench and deadlift. Identify where you want to go from where you are. Once you&#39;ve done that it&#39;s time to pick a program. </p>

<p>Reddit is full of weak nerds who love Stronglifts 5x5 but to be honest there isn&#39;t much wrong with it, just don&#39;t stick with it past a year or so. Here&#39;s a link to the stronglifts website: <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/">https://stronglifts.com/5x5/</a> </p>

<p>Additionally here&#39;s a link to the app which should assist you in keeping track of your progress and setting up/modifying your lifting sessions.  <a href="https://stronglifts.com/apps/#gref">https://stronglifts.com/apps/#gref</a> </p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s fascination with 5x5 aside, I&#39;ve always been more partial to Wendler&#39;s 5/3/1 program. You can read about that here:  <a href="https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner">https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner</a> </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an app that is free which I&#39;ve used in the past:  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/531-strength/id1062989244">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/531-strength/id1062989244</a> </p>

<p>Look at both of these programs and decide what you feel is best for you, but remember that you have to stick with it once you&#39;ve made your choice. A lot of people fuck up and hop from program to program without allowing any single program to work over the time needed. Once you&#39;re about a year or so into lifting you&#39;ll have enough strength and knowledge to serve as an adequate foundation when moving forward and selecting a more advanced program. </p>

<p>With both of the above programs you&#39;ll want to supplement with some accessory exercises, I&#39;d suggest both barbell and dumbell curls for aesthetics and farmers walks just for the added strength. ( <a href="https://www.t-nation.com/training/farmer-s-walk-cure">https://www.t-nation.com/training/farmer-s-walk-cure</a> )</p>

<p>Also, eat well. If you&#39;re looking to put on mass you&#39;ll want to eat at a caloric surplus. For the first few months that surplus won&#39;t matter as much as you&#39;ll get what are called noob gains regardless, but once you&#39;re in the thick of it you&#39;ll want to eat right. You should consume about 1.5-2 grams of protein per lb of body weight. At the end of the day consisting hitting your macros is more important than protein intake though. I won&#39;t go into much detail regarding nutrition as I am not a nutritionist and I eat like shit and drink on weekends. I will however link you this. Diet gets trickier the more niche your diet is, ie. vegan, paleo, carnivore, whatever- the overall rules remain the same though. </p>

<p><a href="https://stronglifts.com/nutrition/#gref">https://stronglifts.com/nutrition/#gref</a> </p>

<p>Basically, figure out what you want, pick a program, eat right and keep working. If you&#39;re in your 20s this should be easy and if you start lifting in your 20s you&#39;ll probably hit your peak in your mid 30s. </p>

<p>Now, I say all of this as someone who doesn&#39;t quite follow the rules and can often be found fucking around and not on program/eating correctly; I&#39;d be a lot stronger and better off if I ate better and stayed on a strict program.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to throw in a bit of cardio and maybe go on a distance run once a week.</p>
