<p>Here is the link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fuxyrb/the_guy_who_left_his_girlfriend_because_he_found/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x">https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fuxyrb/the_guy_who_left_his_girlfriend_because_he_found</a>/</p>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think it can be a sign of any of those things dude. Doing a gangbang is just sex. It doesn&#39;t mean anything about your character. I masturbate to rough shit but that doesn&#39;t mean I want to rape or some shit </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You kidding? If my girlfriend told me she once had a gangbang and enjoyed it, i&#39;d ask for another one and let my friends join in! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nah. Her bdy, her choice. What she does with her body before she met him is none of his concern. She dodged a bullet there. </p>

<p>Not everyone has the same hang ups as you do, my man</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What kind of neckbeard incel bullshit is this? It happened before they were together, who gives a shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck you dude. You don&#39;t just get to believe what I&#39;d been thinking the whole time now that it&#39;s convenient for you. First apologize to me for your original opinions, shithead.</p>

<p>And look: the fact that you just very recently had those problematic opinions does not just mean that you get to be woke within a matter of clicks; you still have a lot of rethinking to do. So shut up. Say you&#39;re sorry, SHUT THE FUCK UP, and start listening: the adults are talking, and what we have to say will impact generations to come.</p>

<p>It might indicate that she&#39;s into getting railed by a football team worth of guys at one time. Why should he risk her deciding to scratch that itch, some time after they&#39;re married?</p>

<p>But since the simps like and get off on having their partner playing musical dicks, I understand why this viewpoint is alien to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I masturbate to rough shit but that doesn&#39;t mean I want to rape or some shit </p>

<p>Since he&#39;s probably a male feminist, I&#39;d say we&#39;re looking at an alibi being established here.</p>
