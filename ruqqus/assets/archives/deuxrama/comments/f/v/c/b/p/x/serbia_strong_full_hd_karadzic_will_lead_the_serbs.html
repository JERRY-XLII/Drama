    <div class="md"><p>What propaganda? Where would they hear it? Because they hear the exact opposite from: every TV station, all of Hollywood, the entire education system from kindergarten to postgraduate, all large political parties in the Western world, every tech platform bar none, and any other established entity. <strong>Hearing the truth from shitposters on extremely fringe internet forums, in the face of full-spectrum brainwashing from birth, does in fact make one more of a free thinker.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>When he says &quot;Ustase&quot;, he is referring to the Nazi WW2 regime in which Hitler put the Croats in charge and they proceeded to culturally enrich the Serbs with genocide. The &quot;Turks&quot; are their neighbors which are the same race as them and speak the same language, but happen to share a religion with the actual Turks who tried to exterminate the Serbs over 150 years ago.</p>

<p>So by Serb logic in 1991 when all these republics started seceding the only logical thing to do was exterminate them in self defense, and commit the world&#39;s first self defense rapes. Karadzic was the president of the Republic of Srpska(where Krajina is located), openly threatened Muslim extermination in 1991, and now is unsurprisingly going to die in a Dutch prison cell. Basically America spent several years asking them nicely to stop exterminating Muslims and raping them, they said no and were bombed into stopping, and they still consider themselves the victim because of that to this very day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Acutally I cannot agree with all you said. I was visiting Zagreb, Split, Sibenik,... etc last summer and I must confess one thing, they really do hate Serbian people out there. I remember there was a married couple with kids and they ( Croats ) cut their tires because they were Serbs. They saw the car registrations and just did it no matter that the couple had small kids. However, there are many graffiti on the walls all around Croatia with &quot; U &quot; letter which means &quot;Ustacha&quot; and ever more graffiti &quot; Kill Serb &quot; , &quot; Hang Serb &quot; ,... etc,.. man, that&#39;s all around Croatia, not just at one place. Scary s#it out there. After that I had to catch a flight to Serbia. I must say there&#39;s no such things, I mean, you can feel safe no matter where did you came from. I&#39;m sure Croats hate Serbians but not sure why. They killed so many Serbians and Jews during WW2 and also killed many Serbs during 90&#39;s conflict, including civilians... 300k of Serbs leaved the Croatia because Croats want to have country without Serbs... and they are still &quot;Proud&quot; because of that. That&#39;s sick. However, Croatia has nice places to visit, Dubrovnik, Sibenik, Zadar, Pula, Plitvice Lakes..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I was just saying that they like to pretend to be victims. The top 2 Serb excuses are &quot;you are the bad guy because you accidentally killed civilians while stopping us from killing civilians on purpose&quot; and &quot;you broke international law(in order to stop us from murdering and raping on purpose) so you are the bad guy no matter what&quot;. That probably has something to do with the anti-Serb hatred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, killing civilans is not a crime?? Lol you are really funny. Croats killed many civilians in last 100 years and still trying to do the same with the rest. I mean, think about it before you say it. 300.000 of Serbs are forced to leave the Croatia ( during 90&#39;s ) from their homes, and you are saying they are not the victims? God help you, boy. 700k of people killed by Croat Ustacha at the Sava river and you are saying they were not the victimes? Come on. Stop it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I am not Croatian or any kind of Jugoslav. Second of all, I only ever specifically referenced the common Serb excuses you get about the war and what America did to them. I never said or denied that the Croats committed crimes as well. I was talking about what you hear from Serbs now in 2020, about Bill Clinton and you keep bringing Croats into it as if that obligates them to pretend Serb war crimes never happened or downplay them, or to pretend that America didn&#39;t bomb in response to those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That means you have no idea what r u talking about. I&#39;m a proffesor of History at the University. 
All you need to do is not to trust the media. The history is not like they told you. Please watch that movie all from the begining and you will know more about &quot;Innocent&quot; civilians. PS genocide never happened in Srebrenica, even intern. jundge said that. Whatch the movie and you will understand. I&#39;m out.</p>
