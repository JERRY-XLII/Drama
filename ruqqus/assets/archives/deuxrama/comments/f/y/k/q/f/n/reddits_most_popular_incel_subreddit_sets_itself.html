<p>What does this even mean? Most of it was just screenshots of <em>the worst</em> anonymous <em>incels</em>, and even then it was often fake, satire or copypastas. </p>

<p>Just like many other similar subreddits (<a href="/r/insanepeoplefacebook">/r/insanepeoplefacebook</a>, <a href="/r/facepalm">/r/facepalm</a>, etc.) it&#39;s just a circlejerk of seeth- and laughfuel against your puppeteered enemies and coping that you&#39;re at least &quot;one of the good guys.&quot; </p>

<p>Either be a jerk, or be a fucking white knight crusader who&#39;s actually trying to make a positive change in the world.</p>

<p>Laughing at mentally ill people is not a nice thing. Don&#39;t pretend your sub is good just because it&#39;s laughing at &quot;bad&quot; mentally ill people, you&#39;re causing radicalisation and worse you&#39;re derailing any possible efforts to address the incel problem in a more productive manner.</p>

<p>Did I say it&#39;s an excuse?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s pick something you&#39;re not so obsessed with. Drug addicts. They&#39;re generally shitty people, and while their mental illness is not an excuse, it&#39;s certainly a contributing factor, and just mocking junkies probably won&#39;t help them get better.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So would mocking you make you less of a jerk?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We arent whiteknights.</p>

<p>As long as you&#39;re <em>really</em> clear about that. I just think that maybe some of your board members tell themselves that they&#39;re actually doing a good thing by somehow &quot;fighting&quot; the incel menace (guess what, you&#39;re just fanning the flames). </p>

<p>Every joke has a victim. You can&#39;t have humor without victimising people (if you disagree, please feel free to tell me any single joke without a victim, even puns have victims - everyone within earshot). Jokes are funny because they are mean at some level (either fake-mean or actually mean).</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be fake-mean to people who don&#39;t like. You just end up bullying, dehumanising, and generally being a jerk.</p>

<p>I&#39;m OK with this in some cases. But was it in any way unexpected that your sub became a hateful cesspit?</p>

<p>The fundamental problem is, it&#39;s not really ever going to be accepted by feminists. You simply can&#39;t tell guys how to approach women without pissing off feminists.</p>

<p>Sexual aggression (being a little rapey) and sexual assertion (being good at getting laid) and being an ineffectual nice guy / incel is a continuum. The line is where you think behaviour is &quot;OK&quot;. But since the line is kinda arbitrary (someone is always going to feel that a guy being &quot;assertive&quot; is actually harassing) then you will either rely on men being mind-readers (which takes experience) or you have to be OK with a few women being harassed.</p>

<p>Either you weren&#39;t really being good (you started acting like TRP people brag about acting, but maybe a bit less of a jackass - you might have called it &quot;flirting&quot; not &quot;negging&quot;) or you were lucky (she desperately wanted to jump on your cock despite your best efforts to stop her - see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/fyr43r/i_married_an_incel_ama/">https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelExit/comments/fyr43r/i_married_an_incel_ama/</a>)</p>

<p>You probably have some unrelated qualities (tall? not hideous?). Or were just really lucky (incels don&#39;t realise that while being short might make 10x less women interested, if you&#39;re trying 2x as hard for 5x as long you&#39;ll eventually do ok.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not just gonna scream &quot;cuck&quot; at you like an incel. But I don&#39;t think that &quot;just being a genuinely good person&quot; is really a massive selling point in the dating market.

    <div class="md"><p>I think men and women can both be just as brutal. I have seen it from both sides. I added to my previous comment regarding your edits. And I came to realize a long time ago people who are incel or identify as such are not all bad shitty sexist people. So there are things I dont agree with that inceltears stood for...like the blanket focus on them and the subs name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cycle of the self-important smugposter:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Endless snark and smugposting when they have mod privileges and a community to back them up, double standards when it comes to enforcing mod rules or even their own convictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Once all this goes away or they find themselves outside their echo chamber and they suddenly see themselves on the other side of the downvoting, endless snark and trolling brigade, they post their life story which of course is a series of tragic events that makes others feel sorry about them.</p></li>

<p>I get it.  I really do.  But one thing I&#39;ve never done when on a suicidal bender is dox some random guy and call him an incel because I thought it would be funny.  And if I did do that, I would feel really bad about it and own up to it.  You pretending like this event never happened or wasn&#39;t a big deal makes it very difficult for me to have any sympathy for you.</p>

That was in reference to a post he made about some bombing in Brazil, with a title that said something along the lines of &quot;This is what happened when Fight Club was released in Brazil.&quot; All the commentors sperged about how they hated that movie.

<p>I saw it cross-posted to <a href="/r/neckbeard">/r/neckbeard</a>, by some IT douche, so I tagged BrazilianSigma in that thread to ask him if he really believes that any violent media truly causes violence in real life. That was months ago, I&#39;m still waiting for a response.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to hate on FF7 for stupid reasons, it has everything that makes it progressive, but it&#39;s Japanese, and Japanese anything is bad according to anti-incels, so they&#39;re gonna say &quot;MuH ToXiC MaScUlInItY&quot; and find other reasons to hate on the game.  </p>

No, you are not allowed to do that.  Seriously you&#39;ve got a personality disorder or something if you don&#39;t realize how fucked-up that was.</p>

<p>Not even joking, I can&#39;t tell what the difference between the official incels and your kind of incel is.  The behavior is that similar.</p>
