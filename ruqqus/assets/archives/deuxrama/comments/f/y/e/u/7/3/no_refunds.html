    <div class="md"><p>Literally I&#39;ve never been more satisfied my a use of money in my life, why would I want a refund? If I could go back in time I&#39;d contribute more, that&#39;s my only regret.</p>

<p>Also congrats man, the cataclysm that destroys the capital stock is about 5-10 years away, if that. The fact is that there is too much capital chasing too little income, it is not mathematically possible for the economy to just recover from this cycle. You can print money in droves to buy capital and artificially support their value, even if there&#39;s a short term recovery it&#39;s going to collapse because people don&#39;t have the wages to pay the rents owed on capital that highly overvalued. This is the inherent contradiction of capital, the goal of capitalism is simply to grow the capital stock to extract more rent, but that rent comes from wages ultimately and eventually there&#39;s not enough wages. When you start firing people to protect your profit you make the problem worse because now there&#39;s even fewer people to pay the rents, when you cut people&#39;s wages to buyback your stock your more somehow expecting even more rent in an economy with even less wages.</p>

<p>This leads to mass social instability, funding by the elites of fascists who distract with wanton cruelty to scapegoating, and finally massive world wars as the fascist nation puts its mass of unemployed to use by conscripting them eb masse.shredding bodies in a meat grinder in a desperate last chance attempt to prop up their capital by looting other nations. The mass of innocents sacrificed on the altar of capital will never make the impossible possible, the cataclysm inevitably destroys rhe capital stock the upper class has been so greedy and committed so many sins to protect. </p>

<p>And then the economy booms once again, as people emerge from the ruins, there&#39;s suddenly tons of work af tons of wages and almost no rent owed to owners of capital stock. The capital stock was the promote the whole time it turns out, not the jews, not the undocumented workers, not the Chinese worker, not any fellow worker. The very class that capitalism holds as holy above all, was always the issue, and is the issue. Neither the delusional nature of late neoliberal capitalism, nor the rampant decadent cruelty she scapegoating if fascism, can make the impossible possible, the wealthy cannot be paid what they claim themselves to be owed. </p>

<p>This is the cycle of capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but you&#39;re absolutely balls to the wall retarded if you think exponential growth is sustainable. We can absolute rework market based systems to be less stupid.

    <div class="md"><p>You may not be happy. That‚Äôs kind of easy to tell. The rest of us will continue to enjoy life, go on dates, bring hot chicks over to enjoy Netflix on 4K TV‚Äôs.  There was no master plan for this, it‚Äôs how humanity organically evolved. Everything is on speed dial. It‚Äôs fantastic. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re absolutely balls to the wall retarded if you think exponential growth is NOT sustainable. Growth and humanity go together.  It‚Äôs a package deal.  You could not stop humanity from growing even if you tried. That means jobs, children, markets, growth. Another fun note for you is that about 350,000 babies were born today. Some people see that as good, some don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm betting you‚Äôre a half full kinda guy right?</p>

<p>Also don‚Äôt give up on humanity. We‚Äôve survived much worse conditions then this.  Think of the Bubonic that plague killed a third of Europe under horrendous conditions. No food delivery, no unemployment checks.  However it did set the stage for the renaissance. An economic boom time. And now it‚Äôs 500 years later. Humanity has a bit more experience and technology on its side. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can absolute rework market based systems to be less retarded. </p>

<p>When a way is provided that‚Äôs sustainable, logical and profitable it will naturally come to fruition. There‚Äôs lots of room for improvement when it comes to alternative energy. Lots of room.</p>

<p>Now that we have established that you are both a bad girl and daddy&#39;s girl, I believe you&#39;d agree with me when I say that you deserve a spanking. Am I not correct? A bad girl deserves a spanking, and as I am daddy, you are my girl, so I am the one who must provide punishment.</p>
