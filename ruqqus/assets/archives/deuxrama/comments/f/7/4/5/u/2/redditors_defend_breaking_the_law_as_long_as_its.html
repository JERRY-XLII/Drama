    <div class="md"><p>I think the fundamental flaw with their take is that ‚Äúthe right‚Äù is purely a US politics based term. It doesn‚Äôt really describe where the line is for other countries. ‚ÄúThe right‚Äù in like Iran would think ‚Äúthe right‚Äù in US as godless thots. </p>

<p>It‚Äôs not even about the religions. If the scenario was flipped, you cannot even criticize backwards cultures.</p>

<p>Let me tell you something that happened to me a few years back. I was on some anon social media app. I forgot the name. It was the rave back then. I was talking to another anon who claimed they were German, born and raised in Germany. </p>

<p>The topic was immigration and I said that </p>

<ul>
<li>  as someone who came from a more conservative (ultra conservative on the west‚Äôs standards) background,  if I were to immigrate to a more progressive society, I would want the people from where I lived to follow me because they are the reason that us making me want to leave everything I know behind. </li>
<li>  I asked them why I should go through all the immigration trouble, uproot my entire life, become an outsider in a new county just to be exposed to these same racist, sexist, bigoted ultra conservative pieces of shit again. </li>
<li>  I suggested an immigration process where they assess your mentality and beliefs instead of education, race, sex, etc. It should be based on how compatible the potential immigrant would be with the local culture and people. </li>
</ul>

<p>That riled them up. They called me a racist even though I suggested a system that doesn‚Äôt judge by race at all. They really believed that I was this vile person. The irony is these fake woke activists are turning their back on people who really need help. Like they want to bring in some dudes who think women are second class citizens and LGBT are sinners just to be seen accepting of other cultures. They hate far right so much? Why do they bring in more far right mindsets and arguably/possibly, way more further to the right than the local far right that they already have? </p>

<p>I don‚Äôt get it! I am the REAL FAR LEFT here because I would kick out all the far right regardless of race, gender, immigrant or citizen, etc out. Like you think gay people are sinners? GTFO, bitch and I would go all China and re-educate your bigoted mind in camps.</p>

<p>What I think is they just hate white people with far right mindset and not really against all far right mindsets. So, they are the racists!</p>

<p>While that is true, they are also not allowed to judge non-white people.  That would make them racist.</p>
