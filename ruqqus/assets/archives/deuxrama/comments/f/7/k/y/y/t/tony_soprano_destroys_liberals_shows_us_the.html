    <div class="md"><p>Iâ€™m so confused, what even is this sub? Is it just really edgy satire? That might aswell be t_d by itâ€™s sincerity. Then I saw some comments saying that itâ€™s welcoming of all people and just to ignore those who say anything rude, which was upvoted, but then so was a reply which intentionally misgendered someone??</p>

<p>I I dont get what is going on here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in my day it was nothin but friggin Eyetalians for miles around in every direction. Hardworkin paisanos, men of honor who worked hard for their money. Not these friggin mulignans with their asses hangin out and 20 fatherless kids running around with dirty feet outside making the neighborhood look like National Geographic. And the worst part is, these apes sell drugs to their own people, you never ever do that shit to your own kind.</p>

<p>You know what I did when I was your age and I needed money? I put on my suit, gelled my hair and made myself look like a presentable young man and went down the street and extorted protection money from local business owners like Mr. Ferraro and Mrs. Malone. A real Eyetalian man works hard and earns his own money, never forget it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>all I ever saw was AJ being a big pussy (no disrespect to Big Pussy) and refusing to accept the family way...if that means shooting a waiter in the head in a new jersey parking lot because he fucked up bill splitting thats just how it is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tony said multiple times that he didn&#39;t want AJ to live &quot;the life&quot;. He refused to inculcate AJ into the tradition, which caused him to become an aimless faggot with no identity or purpose. If Tony did more to groom AJ (instead of junkie Christopher) to take over from a young age, he might have had a fighting chance at being a man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s true, and the &quot;life&quot; is very degenerative and harmful, but AJ is still a giant faggot for not exploiting his status during his many adventures of bottle service, construction work, etc. </p>

<p>If you are gonna knife your gramps or suffocate yourself, you need the manhood to Just Do It! AJ was always too much of a baby to take a full step forward</p>
