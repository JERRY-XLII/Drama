<p>lol, my dad is a total narc. I have watched him lie to women (say he hadn&#39;t divorced my mother yet as an excuse to not marry a woman), call a woman he chose to date fat as a reason he wouldn&#39;t have sex with her and then proceed to rage out when she left him and immediately started dating a man that appreciated her (and she cooked and cleaned for us every single night). I have watched him date two women at the same time and shame women for moving on from him quickly even though they were obviously never cheating like he was. Guess what he says? Every woman he has ever dated has BPD. EVERY SINGLE ONE. But my dad? Oh, poor him, no woman appreciates his sad ass who sits in his office all day chain-smoking and ignoring everyone.</p>

<p>Flipside- I have a history of multiple guys who are batshit crazy... like... end up stalking me crazy. The common denominator IS me, but it&#39;s because I didn&#39;t think I could do any better than the &quot;looks like they&#39;re about to shoot up the school&quot; type. I was attracted to them because I felt like they are the only ones who would appreciate having someone as fucked up as me as a gf.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;people with BPD aren&#39;t evil&quot; in the same way that a pitbull isn&#39;t evil because it only follows its instincts while it kills you I guess. Giving BPD people a chance is a lesson that often has to be learned the hard way. And surprise a whole thread that consists of &quot;one standard for me another for thee&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All those tards are claiming they were diagnosed with PTSD because their ex boyfriend didn&#39;t respond to their 47 calls during his work hours or because he decided he needed one night per fiscal year to see his male friends at a bar. If you&#39;re so emotionally unstable that someone being an inattentive partner or calling you fat causes PTSD, you absolutely should not be able to vote.</p>
