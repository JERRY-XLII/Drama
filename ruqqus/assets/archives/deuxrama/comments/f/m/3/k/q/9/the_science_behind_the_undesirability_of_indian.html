        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2020-03-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/wokeaspie.html">wokeaspie</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a post about why Indian men are deemed undesirable with science behind why they look the way they do. Yes exceptions exist and I admit that and there are different environmental factors for every individual on the planet. This is a generalization of a few factors for those of you that are interested in root causes of why Indian men look the way they look on average (again exceptions exist). I am not an academic so if you want a cited source for each point and example, my suggestion to you is do your own research on the concept of mine you doubt or disagree with and come to your conclusions. I dont have the desire or time to debate on every subreddit I will share this with. My argument is predicated on the fact that looks are the primary means of attracting a mate and this is applicable to both genders. I am not saying secondary characteristics like personality or status have no impact on attraction just that looks are the primary means of attraction.</p>

<p>My premise is that the reason Indian men are unattractive surprisingly does not have much to do with genetics. Genetics is a small part of looks and does make an impact but I argue that early environment is the biggest factor. Also I am focusing on Indian men in western English speaking nations like the United States who share more similar early environmental factors as opposed to Indian men in India have a much larger variety of environmental factors based on income/access to resources.</p>

<p>Yes Genetics is a part of it but it is the smallest part of it and I will get it over with first. Genetics does impact frame and height. Indians tend to have a smaller frame and height. Europe is the continent with men of the largest frame and height. Europeans also evolved to process dairy(beyond early childhood) first. The calcium and protein from animal milk over thousands of years helped them develop stronger and larger bones.</p>

<p>White people since they have the least pigment can absorb vitamin D more efficiently from sun light. Vitamin D is positively correlated with testosterone production. Testosterone production during childhood and puberty is linked with masculine/attractive features. Height, jaw, frame, etc. lighter pigmentation helps men with testosterone production. I am not saying darker skin men automatically have less testosterone, I am just saying white men benefit from the extra vitamin D which aids in testosterone production, there are many factors which impact testosterone production. So yes white people genetically benefit with these things but if your parents are armed with this knowledge they can supplement you with calcium, vitamin D, and HGH in childhood you can bridge the gap.</p>

<p>Now on to early environmental factors. Eating hard foods is linked with good jaw growth and development. Indians cuisine does not consist of hard food. Rice and liquid curries are the softest food imaginable. Eating hard foods in early childhood and puberty will lead to a stronger jaw, which is a masculine trait.</p>

<p>Breast feeding. I was born to a F1Visa woman who believed in women in the workforce and STEM bullshit and formula fed me instead of breastfeeding me to focus on her career. Many men from more affluent backgrounds in the west were born to women like this. Indian men coming from the highest earning group in America or no exception. There are numerous studies showing that breastfeeding teaches infants proper tounge posture which is critical for forward facial growth which leads to attractive facial features like the jaw, chin, nose ,etc.</p>

<p>Higher prevelance of seasonal allergies. Since our native land is in south asian which has its own seasons, plants, pollen ,etc. Living in the west we are exposed to different seasons and plant varieties. The pollen from these western trees are foreign to us. I had severe seasonal allergies as a kid. This fact along with me being formula fed lead to me being a mouth breather. I did grow out of the allergies mid puberty which I believe did salvage my face from a 0/10 to a 5/10. Mouth breathing and poor tounge posture and puberty is terrible for facial growth.</p>

<p>Testosterone production in childhood and puberty. Coming from educated immigrant parents in the west the pressure was to study well in school and go to college to do  a STEM field. Everything else was secondary. Indians do not raise well rounded children. Indian culture promotes sedentary lifestyles. I asked my Dad once why he didnt encourage me to do sports as a child. His answer was I dont like sports. On top of that my parents pushed me not to go outside since &#39;I will get dark&#39;. physical activity particularly resistance training boosts testosterone in males of all ages. Many Indian men are not reared to value and participate in  sports/physical activity as opposed to men of other cultures. And since I wasnt going outside when it was sunny. I was not getting the extra vitamin D from the sunlight to further aid in testosterone production.</p>

<p>Also smart phones/computing devices do reduce testosterone. This is something affecting all races of men. STEM maxxing indians tend to spend a lot of time around these devices.</p>

<p>So to top it all off. Yes I do believe genetics is a factor but a majority of it is early environment. Breastfeeding, eating hard foods as a kid, addressing allergy problems head on as a kid, getting physical activity as a kid to boost testosterone, getting vitamin d as a kid to boost testosterone, and getting sufficient calcium as a kid to encourage bone growth. These are all things that must be done to save a future generation of boys of all races to stop being cast away.</p>

<p>I am not saying women are free of fault for their mating choices but We should also put the blame on men and parents. Testosterone in childhood and puberty is linked to male looks like good frame, jaw, etc. Men of all races have become uglier and farther from what women are biologically programmed to find attractive.</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot another part about diet. Since Indian food tends to be carb and fat heavy. Lets be real Indians are known for having bellies. Excessive Abdominal fat is linked to lower testosterone and lower production of HGH. you need testosterone and HGH to be the biggest best looking version of yourself you can be.</p>

<p>I believe Indian men dont have sufficient testosterone production in childhood/puberty and dont eat hard foods in childhood/puberty, dont get enough calcium in childhood/puberty on average, and may be more likely to mouth breathe than their white peers. This affects forward facial growth and bone development. Again Exceptions occur and not every Indian man raised in the west has the same environmental factors. But I think early environment is the key to looks for most people.</p>

<p>If you have disagreements on specific points thats fine but if you agree with my general concept that early environment is crucial to a persons looks please share. Accepting lookism for what it is is a must for any parent with male children. Parents of male children equipped with this knowledge can drastically impact their sons lives in a positive direction by ensuring the environmental factors are all there for them to develop into the best looking adult they can be. We should learn from the tragedies of millenials and older zoomers</p>
