    <div class="md"><p>How about this: China isn&#39;t communist and if it was it would immediately collapse, its just a poorly run offshoot of fascism (though it was originally closer to socialism). Using less arcane terms it has a strict nondemocratic government with state-managed capitalism, originally it had a strict nondemocratic government with a socialist economy. Communism implies no government or private property, which obviously does not apply to China, and if it was communist somehow then Taiwan would just move back in because anarchism is a meme.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Communism, as it was originally outlined by Marx and is understood by academics, somehow has no government. Just because socialist countries larp as communist ones doesn&#39;t mean they actually are. In fact for most of them they correctly identify their governmental systems as socialist and their parties as communist, as socialism was supposed to be a temporary interim stage between capitalism and communism where they would overthrow the bourgeoisie, use the temporary socialist government to reorganize everything, then willingly give up power to the people. The last part is the one they are eternally stuck on because no one would want to willingly give up power and if they did someone else would just take over.</p>

<p>The only real world scenario where you see communism is at the micro-level like small communes or at Buddhist monasteries, because everyone involved in the system has to place the health of the community above their individual wants which people aren&#39;t really capable of doing when they don&#39;t know everyone in the community on a personal basis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but context is important. In an academic/theoretical context I&#39;m sure you can agree that using &quot;communism&quot; to refer to modern China is pointlessly confusing, whereas in everyday context I don&#39;t mind people referring to the USSR as communist because that is how the word is generally used. However, in this context the poster was clearly someone who wants fantasy Marx communism and telling them to move to China doesn&#39;t make sense since modern China bears no resemblance to fantasy Marx communism.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have an argument when you don&#39;t mutually understand the definitions of the words each other is using, an argument about communism where one person is speaking about fantasy Marx communism and the other is speaking about USSR &quot;communism&quot; will get absolutely nowhere and is a waste of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first two sentences, but if you&#39;re forcing people you would call that socialism, not fascism. Fascism is state-managed capitalism (similar to mercantilism) except it also builds a specific racial/cultural/religious identity into the state and encourages citizens to be loyal to the greater identity and state over all other loyalties which is probably why it seems to have comparatively less issues with corruption. Wealth is not equally distributed in fascism and private property/businesses/wages still exist, the government simply has the ultimate authority over all business and can intervene whenever they want.</p>

The problem with them, and all of the other socialists worldwide, is that they’re lazy and apathetic losers who will never accomplish anything in their life.  Any socialist with any sort of drive would just become a successful capitalist.  The problem with socialism is that it’s only proponents are a bunch of people who literally admit they’re unable to do things for themselves and need government assistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been successful self governing communes before and several nature tribes live in a form of communism. It&#39;s also suspected that stone age tribes lived in a form of it.</p>

<p>So no, absolutely untrue. But communism couldn&#39;t possibly exist while reactionary capitalist nations seek to even destroy any faintly socialist countries.</p>
