<p>“For decades, Americans have experienced a populist uprising that only benefits the people it is supposed to be targeting.... The angry workers, mighty in their numbers, are marching irresistibly against the arrogant. They are shaking their fists at the sons of privilege. They are laughing at the dainty affectations of the Leawoof toffs. They are massing at the gates of Mission Hills, hoisting the black flag, and while the millionaires tremble in their mansions, they are bellowing out their terrifying demands. &#39;We are here,&#39; they scream, &#39;to cut your taxes.”</p>

<p>Are those failures more prevalent in government run healthcare systems?</p>

<p>Seems like pandemic if you want a vaccine or a bed is working a lot better in market based healthcare than government run healthcare.</p>

<p>Notice the drugs being used are created in a market based healthcare system. And the people running the hospitals are subject to criteria ie profitability to at least be somewhat competent at their job.

<p>Lol, Italy has a vastly superior healthcare system to the US. Any system, market-based or government-run is subject to being overwhelmed during a pandemic. This is as retarded as the arguments you see people making about &quot;wait times&quot; to claim the US healthcare system isn&#39;t trash tier while ignoring the fact we ration care by ability to afford.</p>

<p>The UK? Better healthcare outcomes than America. The US has by far the worst-performing healthcare system in the entire western world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have like 200 times more hospital beds per 100k people than Italy. The entire U.K. has 8 icu beds. The number of beds means more staff more nurses. Means a market based system can withstand more influx for a pandemic.</p>

<p>Also way to ignore the fact that all the vaccines being made and the drugs being used are from a market based healthcare system.</p>

<p>This is just like everything the USA has the war machine that keeps Europe safe, the innovation America creates the more hours worked the life saving drugs and technological breakthroughs are all just utilized by the socialist communist governments of Europe and China and they just pretend they invented it or in Europe’s case like oh we don’t need to spend on NATO or create medicine.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We have like 200 times more hospital beds per 100k people than Italy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, we do not.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/SH.MED.BEDS.ZS">https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/SH.MED.BEDS.ZS</a></p>

<p>Italy for example has 3.4 per 1000. We have 2.9. </p>

<p>1</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entire U.K. has 8 icu beds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is false.</p>

<p>The US does have the most ICU beds per 100k, but the entire UK doe snot have &quot;8 ICU beds.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of beds means more staff more nurses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A) The US has less total hospital beds per 1k than other countries. </p>

<p>B) The US does not actually have more nurses/staff than other countries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Means a market based system can withstand more influx for a pandemic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given pretty much everything you just said above was outright false, in what universe do you think you have even a basic comprehension of healthcare systems and their ability to withstand pandemics?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also way to ignore the fact that all the vaccines being made and the drugs being used are from a market based healthcare system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, the only country close to a corona vaccine is Israel, not a market based system.</p>

<p>I stopped reading here. Your general economic illiteracy and disdain for basic facts leads me to believe you&#39;re a troll or profoundly ignorant moron. Both of which mean I&#39;m not going to waste my time attempting to educate you.</p>

<p>Agreed, and despite being functionally retarded, they still understand the importance of family and social norms better than a 135iq coastal bugman.</p>
