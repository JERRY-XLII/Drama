<h1>[EFFORTPOST] The Great Race War begins as white power stronghold and notorious sausagefest <a href="/r/raceplay">/r/raceplay</a> erupts into chaos, pitting white males against their one true enemy: actual black women who are also into raceplay</h1>

<h1>Backstory</h1>

<p>Like most of Reddit, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raceplay/">r/raceplay</a> user base is almost entirely male. 95% of the posts are either sad white dudes showing their cocks and demanding worship from basketball americans and coronavirus victims, or sad white dudes hiding behind stolen facebook pics and insta thots while pretending to women and demanding lewd comments. So also like most of Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raceplay/">r/raceplay</a> is an embarrassing shithole that only reinforces the urgent need for mayocide.</p>

<p>Actual nonwhite women posting on the sub are an absolute rarity. Even rarer are the ones that post semi-regularly. So rare, in fact, that I can count all of the long-term female residents on one hand. You might think that being such a rare and precious resource, thirsty moids would do every in their power to encourage new women who discover this fetish to stay around and participate. You would be wrong. No, every time a biological woman appears, a horde descends upon her with &quot;witty&quot; bantz amounting to SUCK MY DICK NIGGER BITCH NIGGER NIGGER NIGGER BITCH SLUT NIGGER, in the mistaken belief that this will somehow compel her to drop those panties. This of course works for transracial LARPing troids, but for reasons we may never fully understand, this approach always fails with actual females. Time and time again, Pussies of Color literally offering what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raceplay/">r/raceplay</a> posters want most are driven away, thus ensuring the sub is kept pure and free of woman&#39;s taint.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>The new negresses are fighting back.</p>

<p>The Great Race War is upon us.</p>

<p>Mayo moids, chocolate foids, and closeted troids have spent the last several days slapfighting all over and just generally shitting up the sub. Over what, you might ask? It would be shorter to list all the things they <em>aren&#39;t</em> fighting over. Catfishing posters are being called sissies and faggots, ironic racists are being accused of actual racism, and the actual racists are, well, still being actual racists. Mods are blamed for doing too much and not doing enough. Appeals to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AHS/">r/AHS</a> to ban the sub are repeatedly invoked. A tiny sect of chocolate foids have even seceded from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raceplay/">r/raceplay</a> and are currently developing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raceplayfantasies/">r/raceplayfantasies</a> in the hopes that EXTREME MODERATOR ACTION with a team of diversity hires can save the fetish from itself.</p>

<h1>Key players to watch:</h1>

<p>Succubus_Sin - a Prostitute of Color who passionately hates black men, spends her time on the sub blasting black men, white men, broke men, other black women... pretty much everyone, while also spamming her own Pornhub videos. Also a TERF and a massive weeb who believes she&#39;s a witch with literal magic powers. Also engaged to a white CUCK</p>

Less than ten girls pic posters here are real and Iâ€™m being generous. I can see why they are brigading to get this sub shut down. Itâ€™s not race play if youâ€™re using stolen photos. Assholes.&quot;</a></li>
