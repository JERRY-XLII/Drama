    <div class="md"><p>dont know if you&#39;ve noticed, but we&#39;re crushing most of europe&#39;s stats.  and unlike europe, we didn&#39;t shut down our equivalent to their national borders, our state borders.</p>

<p>and unlike SK and singapore, we&#39;re not a fucking island, and with have a significantly larger population.  SK literally closed their borders immediately, and hunted down anyone who had traveled and immediately put them in quarantine.  that&#39;s not physically possible in the US.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/t21h8z6q88q41.jpg">as for the leftard bullshit...</a> that nonsense continued well after trump banned travel, well after he declared a national emergency.</p>

<p>even sillier, the lead epidemiologist on the imperial model team admitted over half of the deaths are from people who were terminal in the first place, either expressly by doctor&#39;s designation, or actuarially, they were going to die within 6 months.  moving their death from one cause to another is shit logic for any sort of policy decision.</p>

<p>people like you are just outrage faggots looking for something to complain about.  you have no answers, and are mired in failure.</p>

<p>Name them. From the collage tell me exactly which leftist newspaper that has any relevance among leftists. Tell me which news article downplayed Covid after the national emergency was called out and is leftist. Tell me the headline and the name from the picture. We can both see the same image.</p>

<p>you&#39;re just salty that millions of people aren&#39;t going to die, and people are going to re-elect trump in a sweeping landslide.  your two choices are a pedophile with dementia, and a communist with staunch support from a loud 6% of the population who are total and complete losers, and no support from anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iâ€˜m not walking back aynthing. You said that leftist media was still downplaying covid even after Trunp declared national emergency... if you want to claim that, show me a news article of a leftist news outlet with an article downplaying covid after the declaration of the emergency situation. You canâ€˜t because there arenâ€˜t.</p>

<p>Youâ€˜re walking away from your own claim while sounding like a butthurt bitch at the same time. Amazing.</p>

<p>I never mentioned anything about a travel ban so donâ€˜t act like Iâ€˜m walking back on anything there. Learn to read. I never talked about that, never mentioned it, donâ€˜t care.</p>

<p>Iâ€˜m not american. Iâ€˜m simply happy that around 100k americans will die. Itâ€˜s that simple.</p>
