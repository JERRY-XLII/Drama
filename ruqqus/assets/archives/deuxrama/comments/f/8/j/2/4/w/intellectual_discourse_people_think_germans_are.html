        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Upon living and mating with the Krauts for 2 years now. I have experienced being fucked by the state. They fuck me with public television fees when I don&#39;t even own a TV. And they fuck me with bureaucracy when I try to get a birth certificate for my latest bastard child. </p>

<p>When I questioned these things, The Britbongs larping as Krauts reacted like I just started anally raping their mother at her funeral.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re unwilling to follow rules, then go back to your country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sums up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Germany">r/Germany</a> </p>

<p>I come from a country where rules are viewed as guidelines or suggestions. I am really struggling with following rules. As one German once said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the German reaction to rules, the state, and any laws is to..I suppose metaphorically bend over and accept the fucking. We fuck each other too a lot in the service industry and in dealings. It is a cultural problem I wish we could reform and grow some spinal cords. We are a nation of mediocre simply for the case that there is not much motivation or reason to excel at anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what about the Nazis. They were <strong><em>BASED.</em></strong> Right?</p>

<p>Wrong. Ask yourself. Why would Germans vote for Adolf Hitler? </p>

<p>Because he was a dictator who would put rules that control every small aspect of their lives. And the German cuck loves to be dominated. </p>

<p>Which also explains why Germany is the birthplace and school of the dominatrix. </p>

<p>To sum it up. The Nazis killed Jews, Communists, gays, cripples, and retards. (Basically, all the things that make a Chapo). And they have done all these &quot;horrible&quot; things for one simple reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We were just following orders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hang on. Let&#39;s have a discussion here. </p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t mind the Germans electing Hitler and the whole Nazi thing as much (even though I&#39;m Polish/Russian and my entire ancestry was in the meat grinder) because I believe the general population ARE cucks everywhere. We as a society need a drop of totalitarianism under correct leadership in order to get shit done as it provides a much needed &quot;goal&quot; to strive for and discourse to keep motivated. </p>

<p>If I was a dictator I&#39;d push for industrialization of the inner asteroid belt which even (((corporations))) wouldn&#39;t mind as it&#39;s near infinite resources compared to terrestrial operations. </p>

<p>People left to their own devices will succumb to vices, degeneracy and other species crippling cockplay such as politics. Maybe I&#39;m fucked in the head but I always draw a comparison of our current system to Dr.Doom as most based capeshit since earth would only survive under his leadership when he commuted with a cat god that showed him all realities so he went on a crusade to preserve humanity. People demonize him while the right thing isn&#39;t what&#39;s &quot;morally right&quot; for everyone. </p>

<p>So I support totalitarianism because I want our species to band together and make an impact since we were blessed with self awareness in this vast void.</p>

<p>I agree with you. I come from a country that is ruled by a monarchy.</p>

<p>Nobody ever talks about politics because there are no politics.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t change things. You are allowed to give suggestions for changes you&#39;d like to say. If your suggestion is good, then big daddy decrees it as a new rule. If your suggestion is bad, then you&#39;re beheaded. Things are just that simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah absolutely, modernize totalitarianism to model maybe late Rome? 600 strong senate with a &quot;supreme chancellor&quot; / &quot;emperor&quot; esc. character elected based on a proposed 10 year plan with a &quot;veto&quot; clause to kill him if he deviates too much from pitched policy as a senator. </p>

<p>I understand this is super unrealistic considering we would have to have 600 groups of people or so thinking similarly or in one interest in order to even get a shot at this. I like the Watchmen approach where a hoax alien threat or even a real one will unite the globe since we will realize we arent king shit anymore and can die because we squabble over immediate pleasures and arent thinking with prosperity of our species as a whole.</p>
