    <div class="md"><p>With enough imagination, i guess. But personally the building of socialist consciousness isn&#39;t about getting rid of all forms of personal and private property immediately, the experiments of the 20th century showed eventually the capitalist inclination returns and it makes sense in the grand scheme of things. Higher phase communism cannot be acheived until an advanced form of capitalism is in place, and humanity has not reached that point yet. And it may be several hundred years before we evolve enough to relinquish ourselves of Cultural Capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not too much imagination. The Mac book stolen from the OWS protest years ago that angered the dork who thought it was personal property, could also be used to make money.  Online sex workers sell stuff like piss or used clothing to make money.  The difference is easily blurred.</p>

<p>What people want is luxury gay space communism where they don&#39;t need to work.  What they forget about that sci-fi genre is that everyone capable of working does regardless of scarcity being overcome.  That&#39;s done partially to avoid those being useful becoming resentful of the lazy and avoid accidentally transporting them into open space or tossing them out of the air lock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occupy was a movement of anarchists, more or less, and they are the most retarded leftists on the planet who refuse to learn or evolve theory, they always have been. A laptop is personal property, and if some bitch wants to sell her piss that is totally fine technically, since she is not employing anyone en masse, and this is what I mean by private property. Private implies employment of workers with set wages, things like that. But again Im not advocating the dismantling of all forms of property immediately a revolution, because we saw what happened in last century. I align more with the post-revolution theorists in China, basically having markets is okay, paying wages to workers is fine since the law of value isn&#39;t going to magically disappear with a red flag is raised, but everything is under the eyes of the communist party. Having billionaires is fine, we dont want to be poor Socialists, we want wealth and abundance. However Billionaires routinely get abducted by the party, and I&#39;m okay with this to an extent, and president Xi is okay in my books. </p>

<p>Today&#39;s leftists are not like the leftists who founded the Soviet state or formed the short lived Paris commune. Today they are usurped by a hyper-liberal mentality, where class struggle has basically been abandoned in favor of chopping our ducks off and taking the a out of womxn. This hyper-moralization is a silent admission of ideological defeat, since the building of socialism to reach communism failed every single time in the last century, and now all the left can do is cry about Trump being fascist (even tho he isn&#39;t) and supporting imperialist, faggot democrats.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying here is that <em>a</em> communism is probably inevitable in the future, it may arise in ways none of us could imagine, under conditions no Marxist or Chomsyist could ever muse about in some prosaic magnum opum. I say this because even some capitalists admit if capitalism continues the way it is, and globalization matures through the generations, communism could be reached. Which oddly is what Marx wrote about, that contradictions of capitalism lie the bedrock for future socialist agitation and economic prosperity that gives birth to communist society. So Marx was wrong about a lot of things, but maybe he was right about a few things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Name a single government or state which did not have some form of abuse in its structure. </p>

<p>Did party officials have access to extra utilities because of their positions? No doubt. Did they receive a stipulation for their work? Yes, just like every other politician in the world for that matter. </p>

<p>Did life expectancy double for the average worker within a span of generation after the Soviets seized the state? Yes. Did the literacy rate nearly triple? Yes. Did the Union of Soviets go from basically a semi-fuedal wasteland into a massive industrialized powerhouse that was a contending power against USA and took us into space first? Yes, and that would have not been possible without a healthy, growing population. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be eaten alive because Soviet caloric intake was on par with the capitalist west. However if a socialist government came into being with the values of today&#39;s &quot;left&quot;, I would no doubt be thrown to the wall with fascists and killed.</p>

Before US gained independence from Britain, a minorty of property owners would write polemics and spread their message.
