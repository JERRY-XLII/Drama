At this point you&#39;re just being childish, reaching desperately for some way to be right when you&#39;re so very wrong. You can keep trying, but you&#39;ve failed to make any progress thus far and won&#39;t unless you change your tactics. Repeatedly attacking my &quot;reading comprehension&quot; is just another sign you have no purpose here other than to try and offend me, which makes sense given what you&#39;re defending but won&#39;t actually get you anywhere, particularly when you&#39;re so wrong. Are you going to keep digging yourself into a deeper hole, or do you want to quit now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For more info on this latest installment in r/WatchRedditLie, see <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a>.</p>

<p>In short: There&#39;s no AHS Discord, that&#39;s not my Discord account, the accusations made in the video these screenshots were taken from, are absolutely false, and that video - and the linked post - have been forwarded to my attorney, to pass on to law enforcement as needed.</p>

<p>If anyone wants to see what it looks like when a subreddit is shut down for sexualisation of minors, that person can examine the shutter page for r/AgePlayPenPals --</p>

<p>&quot;This subreddit was banned due to a violation of Redditâ€™s content policy against minor sexualization.&quot;</p>

<p>On September 10, 2019. Three days after r/AgainstDegenerateSubs was created -- a shuttering for which the people at r/AgainstDegenerateSubs take credit ... despite APPP being on final notice with the admins already regarding the fact that they were aiding &amp; abetting sexualisation of minors.</p>

<p>In the days leading up to September 10, 2019, r/AgainstHateSubreddits saw multiple comments and posts made by WatchRedditDie ecosystem-tagged accounts, demanding that r/AgainstHateSubreddits &quot;stop banning clownworld subs&quot; and &quot;ban AgePlayPenPals&quot;. We also got an uptick in harassing modmails accusing us of being paedophiles in September, because we took down some posts that were &quot;HEY I FOUND SOMEONE POSTING CHILD PORN COME LOOK!!!&quot;, and told the person posting that they must only report minor sexual exploitation to the admins and the FBI / NCMEC -- instead of recruiting people to look at and distribute it on Reddit.</p>

<p>All this happened a month after clown_world, frenworld, r/ParadigmShift2070, and other such anti-Semtism, anti-LGBTQ MillionDollarExtreme ban evasion / harassment subreddits were all shut down.</p>

<p>So, the working hypothesis is this:</p>

<p>The ClownWorld ecosystem got one subreddit shut down for sexualising minors, and said &quot;AH-HA! THIS! THIS IS POWER!&quot;</p>

<p>and proceeded on a campaign to plant / manufacture / frame their targets as possessing / distributing child porn.</p>

<p>REMINDER: DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE LINKED SUBREDDIT. DO NOT COMMENT; DO NOT POST; DO NOT VOTE; DO NOT SUBSCRIBE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so let&#39;s get this straight.</p>

<p>If by &quot;the ClownWorld ecosystem&quot; you mean the &quot;hate subs&quot; users, you&#39;re saying that those people were planting, manufacturing, and framing targets. That they created alt-accounts so they could post child porn to get their own (very active) sub r/ coomer banned and also tried to get the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConsumeProduct/comments/fs0ej1/not_consoomer_related_ahs_whistleblower_reveals/flz3q5v/">very active r/ watchredditdie banned</a>, so they could pin it on AHS. </p>

<p>And then they created <a href="https://streamable.com/krnpt">a fake whistle blower video</a> accusing AHS of using long suspected brigading tactics. Tactics that have been suspected, rumored and witnessed since before r/ milliondollarextreme was banned, well over a year ago.  </p>

<p>So this plan was in the works for months or more, coordinated by users of maybe two dozen subreddits of the hundred or so tagged in masstagger. Users that created and migrated to maybe a few hundred now banned subreddits since, let&#39;s say, r/ milliondollarextreme was banned. In all that time during all those bans that occurred because those users and subreddits were identified by AHS using masstagger, they never simply created alt-accounts to avoid a new migration subreddit from getting identified and subsequently banned. </p>

<p>They used the same masstagged accounts, spread rumors about AHS brigading subreddits to get them banned, enforced those rumors for the past year by creating alt-accounts, pretending to be AHS users who were pretending to be &quot;hate sub&quot; users to get dozens of their own subs banned, relied mostly on speculation and users recounting what they witnessed with maybe one or two flimsy screenshots that could be easily dismissed. </p>

<p>All the while railing against r/ ageplaypenpals, which was not affiliated with AHS, demanding it be banned when they could have used alt-accounts pretending to be r/ ageplaypenpals users like they pretended to be hate sub users to get their own subs banned to blame on AHS.</p>

<p>Then the users railed against subs like r/ wickrfreaks who were posting honest to god child porn, got them banned, sought out similar subs, also not affiliated with AHS like r/ jobuds. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ThisEquipment/comments/ej29s9/rjobuds_is_a_sub_with_over_230k_subscribers_its/">Provided mountains of evidence that they were unmoderated, posting underage and involuntary pornography</a> that was seen across multiple non &quot;ClownWorld ecosystem&quot; affiliated subreddits,</p>

<p>like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dz12le/reupload_deleted_accidentally_reddits_got_a_real/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/dz0qwe/reddits_got_a_real_problem_with_involuntary/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/emida4/how_do_i_provide_more_context_when_reporting_a/">here</a> </p>

<p>and were reported enmasse to the admins, NCMEC, the FBI, gaining enough attention that I was personally contacted by a journalist with CNN among others. Yet those subs still remain active to this day despite all of the evidence that they should be rightfully banned.</p>

<p>And then at that point, the stage being fully set, the plan in the works for months and in private, never being talked about in any of the subreddits that AHS monitors constantly for absolutely anything that could get the sub banned, the users brigade their own subs to get them banned, start posting child pornography to up the ante further. When they didn&#39;t get r/watchredditdie banned the moderators of r/watchredditdie, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/comments/fhgsmz/watch_reddit_lie_understanding_the_latest/">who were in on this plan according to AHS mods</a>, (and apparently pro-child pornography for the sake of free speech according to a single highly downvoted post that doesn&#39;t even belong on the sub)    hobbled their own sub by reviewing and approving all comments to further increase their culpable deniability.</p>

<p>And then, AND then... the users start openly posting and commenting to places like r/4chan, r/gamersriseup, and r/politicalcompassmemes providing evidence that not only are they coordinating on 4chan and 8kun but they actually only recently concocted the tactic of spamming rule breaking content to hate subreddits to get them banned by posing as AHS users so that they could accuse AHS users of being the ones brigading and posting rule breaking content months ago. When in reality it was actually hate sub users, posing as AHS users, posing as hate sub users.</p>

<p>That&#39;s some fucking high level planning. We&#39;re talking at least 7D chess here. Even 9/11 and JFK truthers would say &quot;that&#39;s a little convoluted&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe there&#39;s a simpler answer:</p>

<p>Maybe, a bunch of zealots who have made it their personal crusade to banish anyone who&#39;s ever said anything they don&#39;t like from the internet as well as dox them and attempt to ruin their lives, so much so that they&#39;re paranoid of retribution to point that they&#39;re obsessed with concealing their identities online through a myriad of software tools, who are using FBI level investigative tactics like text analysis to identify undesirables, who everyone knows uses third party plugins to identify on sight anyone who has ever so much as commented in a subreddit they don&#39;t like, are getting increasingly frustrated by a bunch of dipshits who don&#39;t even bother to make new reddit accounts when they migrate to their new shitposting sub.</p>
