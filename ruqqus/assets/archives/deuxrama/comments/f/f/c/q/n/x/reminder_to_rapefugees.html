    <div class="md"><p>They just moved it a bit to the west. Also some Commies taught the Poles how to read for the first time in history, which they still seething about on the internet. Honestly I think teaching Polacks how to read and write is probably the worst sin of the Soviet Union. They are natural born peasants that want to sling mud at each other and take the orders of their Kraut lord. This is the natural state of a Polack. It was misguided of the Russians to try to change who the Polacks were by forcibly industrializing and educating them and giving them modern healthcare. An educated Polack knows nothing but seethe, the only thing they can do with the knowledge of how to read and write is make the rest of the world as miserable as they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing I don&#39;t buy is that all ethno-nationalists are Nazis. Like England was an allied white ethnostate at the time, and the US was still very much racially segregated. And after winning the war what did they do? Literally form a brand new ethnostate. </p>

<p>The whole notion that the war was ever between &quot;supremacy tards&quot; and &quot;everyone else&quot; is pretty fanciful. Everyone involved in WW2 subscribed to some form of racial supremacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we were concerned about Nazis being mean to the Jews before WWII we probably wouldn&#39;t have specifically racially excluded them from immigrating the United States and largely responded to early reports of oppression and attempts by refugees to flee by shrugging our shoulders and saying &quot;Not my problem&quot;. Even after WWII, like Israel was in large part just a result of the huge number of Jewish refugees created after the holocaust and the fact that nobody wanted to deal with them. So we shoved them onto boats and sent them to Palestine and were like &quot;Here you go, here&#39;s some land for you live on, and over there are its furious current owners. Good luck, kthxbye&quot;. They won ofc and this created a bunch more refugees, but they weren&#39;t Europes problem, so all was good pretty much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tbh the entire period of the early 20th century was dominated by some really creepy and extreme forms of scientific racism and social darwinism. The Nazis were the apex and extreme form of this, after the war people looked at what the Nazis were doing and rightfully condemned it. But it was only natural extrapolating backwards and seeing forms of that stuff in their own nation.</p>

<p>Like post Civil War notions of racial equality gave way slowly over a period of about 30 years to ever more extreme racial supremacists. A lot of blame is put on reconstruction and its failures. But even after federal troops left the southern regimes in general were not <em>that</em> extreme at first. A lot of states were dominated by moderates at first and moderate options among white southerners were just as popular pretty much as conservative and radical white supremacist ones. However the radical supremacist ideology slowly grew in power. In 1890, Mississippi passed the first constitution that essentially stripped blacks of voting rights. In about a decade one by one ever southern state fell and passed similar restrictions. </p>

<p>1891 was also the time when the first public lynching of a black person in Oklahoma. <a href="https://evolutionistx.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/picture-181.png">And after this point lynchings of blacks exploded</a>, black people were not actually that commonly lynched before 1890, and lynchings in general were not a public thing before this point. But the lynching in Oklahoma received wide and largely positive coverage. <a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5487/">And I&#39;m talking in New York newspapers, not southern ones.</a> I once posted this and of course the immediate response was defensive, someone was took the guilt of the party in question as a given, after reading literally nothing about the incident besides this surreal article from a journalist not even bothering at impartiality or hiding the jizz leaking out of his pants, and was narrowly focused on the guilt or innocence and crime of the person in question. Seriously, you are missing the forest for the trees. This was not normal. It wasn&#39;t normal for tens of thousands of people to drive in by train and crowd around the platform and watch. This kind of coverage of the incident, was not normal. Reading it is frankly entirely surreal in retrospect. So public, shameless, out in the open lynchings of blacks exploded all over the south, they were widely attended social gatherings. It was <em>not</em> a traditional southern practice before that time, contrary to many people&#39;s notions.</p>

<p>At first many southern governors, like even white supremacists, were taken aback by the sudden introduction of mass popular violence, and opposed it, because they were law and order types who disliked the lack of process. One Georgia governor who opposed lynchings was for the duration of the rest of his term constantly mailed pieces of people who had been lynched, as a joke, because his position was considered laughable. Anyway these politicians were largely replaced in short order.</p>

<p>The practice only abated somewhat after controversy over actual pictures of a particularly brutal lynching in the 1910s where someone was burned alive. The people who actually took these pictures did so largely because they wanted momentos. But actually seeing the violence of people smiling in front of the charred remains shocked the nation and caused a lot of pushback. After this point lynchings largely receded because southerners realized that it was making them look bad. </p>

<p>Two of the last lynchings in the nation took place in the county in which I grew up.</p>

<p>The early 20th century saw the south completely rewrite the history books with the Lost Cause narrative. People all over the nation were sympathetic to this largely garbage account that cast the south as some sympathetic victim, you had films like Birth of the Nation. Seriously, just go read the summary of Birth of a Nation, it makes me want to vomit. This was Woodrow Wilson&#39;s favorite film. This is actually pretty much what started the KKK. Like the actual original KKK was more or less dead by the late 1860s, it was an insurgency crushed by the federal forces. The modern KKK and all its predecessors was basically just fanboys of Birth of a Nation larping.</p>

<p>The 1900&#39;s also saw people literally importing &quot;savage&quot; races from colonies and setting up human zoos, they put a pygmy in a human zoo, an entire tribe of Filipino aboriginals. There was moral indignation, largely from pastors and religious groups, but this was largely mocked in the press, which was largely taken by scientific racist notions and considered it ridiculous that anyone could consider a pygmy as a human being and not some lesser species.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, we passed an immigration law that more or less restricted immigration to northwest europeans, because we were worried about the racial inferiority of Jews and Polacks and Italians immigrating at the time. When Coolidge signed this, he is said to have proclaimed &quot;Let&#39;s keep America American!&quot; This was the slogan of the larp KKK fyi. The 20s also saw forced sterilization programs. Which literally gave the power to just forcibly sterilize people without trial who hadn&#39;t committed any crime, and was found constitutional somehow.</p>

<p>It was only after we won WWII and saw the excesses of that period that there was a serious pushback. It&#39;s not a mistake that Brown vs. Board of Education passed after WWII. There is no way it could have passed before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anglos are like crazy obsessed with and mythologize Nazi military figures, it&#39;s almost bizarre. The Soviets are dismissed as asiatic hordes who were totally quantity over quality. A lot of Soviet technological advances in the period were really impressive though. And by the end of the war the top Soviet generals were amazing and easily better than anything the Nazis had. Or really any of the American generals, who hadn&#39;t done nearly as much fighting and didn&#39;t have the experience. It&#39;s seriously depressing that Rhommel is worshiped like a saint and most people don&#39;t even know who Georgy Zhukov is. Just because of the Cold War, we suddenly had to pretend that WWII was just some island hopping and Normandy and then some nukes and that&#39;s how we killed Hitler.</p>

<p>The Eastern Front <em>was</em> World War II, that was when hell rose up to Earth for a bit, a single thousand mile long battle of annihilation waged to the death by tens of millions for four years, with no mercy offered, and none given. The Second Sino-Japanese war was a smaller conflict that merged into it. The rest, some minor skirmishes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The T-34 had some technological innovations early on in the war, for instance it was the first tank with sloped armor. It was quickly outdated though and clearly it&#39;s advantage largely became numbers. That said the German tanks were just the Krauts jacking themselves off. The Tiger I was an engineering marvel so complicated that only a couple of thousand could be produced in seven years. The Panzer IV was a tank that had been good a decade ago but was both outclassed and massively outproduced by the T-34. The Panther was basically the Germans trying to make their own T-34 after getting pwned by them early on and still overengineering things because they can&#39;t help themselves. And none were even delivered until 1943, like lmao, the battle of stalingrad had already happened, Hitler was just stalling his suicide at that point, it was pointless.</p>

<p>The T-34 was dead simple to produce. It was unreliable and would fall apart in a month but it wasn&#39;t expected to last that long in battle anyway and by the time it did you&#39;d have a dozen more shipped in in its place. It concentrated on all the things it had to to help them win the war, it was reliable as it needed to be to last its estimated service life, and not a second longer, it ignored everything that wasn&#39;t necessary.</p>

<p>The American Shermans were better overall and the Soviets definitely preferred them quality wise when they had them available. But they were only delivered I think by 1944.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. German tanks <em>great</em> in many regards, but weren&#39;t the best in all of them. The real advantage the Panzerwaffe had was in doctrine rather than strictly in technology -- much better concentration of tanks in single units, having radios in every single tank, better internal ergonomics, better division of duties of crew members of tanks. As the other nations caught up in terms of doctrine in 1941/1942/1943, those advantages evaporated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>German tank design was also questionable. Even if were to agree the tanks had superior engineering, the real issue with them was they were too expensive and hard to build. </p>

<p>They got blow away in tank production by the soviets. The soviets had produced some 33 or 35k t-34s and over 20 thousand t-34-85s.</p>

<p>The germans had only managed to produce 1300 king tigers and 7-8k panzers. And Germany had been producing tanks for longer than the soviets had at that point.</p>

<p>For some reason people tend to forget the most important part - having superior engineering isn&#39;t relevant when the other guys out-produce you 4-1. I&#39;d take 4 shermans or t-34s over 1 king tiger.</p>

<p>The soviets at first weren&#39;t ready for them at all.  France was a joke with questionable leadership and outdated tactics. The Brits were, well, the Brits. Everyone in general let Hitler get away with far too much before they declared war. And Germany was no pushover, they were a powerhouse in Europe.</p>

<p>Germany did as well as they did due to serious failures in leadership in every other country. Not so much because they were special, or competent. Once the war dragged on and other countries mobilized the level of German incompetence became more and more clear.</p>

<p>Because the economy relied on conquest to function, they had to keep moving the date of military action closer, well before Germany was able to sustain a multi-front war long term.</p>

<p>Let me word this in a different way - imagine you pick a fight with a guy twice your size. Imagine you know that guy is going to absolutely shit stomp you if you don&#39;t win within the first 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Sure - you make a good effort in those 30 seconds, but you fail to knock him out and end up getting your head stomped in. Does that seem like competence to you?</p>

<p>One part of Germany decided that they could distract from negative  their sack of Greece by taking in a boatload of muzzies from Syria (who were apparently running away from something, even after all Germany had done to help them out by giving shit tons of suspiciously heavy crates with &#39;humanitarian aid&#39; scrawled on them to secular moderates). Five years later and it seems like you&#39;ve got Nazis again. I guess Krauts are a bit like Gremlins, except with Syrians instead of water. Who could have known. Just a bit of advice, if there is a third time, there won&#39;t be a fourth.

    <div class="md"><p>Tbh the entire period of the early 20th century was dominated by some really creepy and extreme forms of scientific racism and social darwinism. The Nazis were the apex and extreme form of this, after the war people looked at what the Nazis were doing and rightfully condemned it. But it was only natural extrapolating backwards and seeing forms of that stuff in their own nation.</p>

<p>Like post Civil War notions of racial equality gave way slowly over a period of about 30 years to ever more extreme racial supremacists. A lot of blame is put on reconstruction and its failures. But even after federal troops left the southern regimes in general were not <em>that</em> extreme at first. A lot of states were dominated by moderates at first and moderate options among white southerners were just as popular pretty much as conservative and radical white supremacist ones. However the radical supremacist ideology slowly grew in power. In 1890, Mississippi passed the first constitution that essentially stripped blacks of voting rights. In about a decade one by one ever southern state fell and passed similar restrictions. </p>

<p>1891 was also the time when the first public lynching of a black person in Oklahoma. <a href="https://evolutionistx.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/picture-181.png">And after this point lynchings of blacks exploded</a>, black people were not actually that commonly lynched before 1890, and lynchings in general were not a public thing before this point. But the lynching in Oklahoma received wide and largely positive coverage. <a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5487/">And I&#39;m talking in New York newspapers, not southern ones.</a> I once posted this and of course the immediate response was defensive, someone was took the guilt of the party in question as a given, after reading literally nothing about the incident besides this surreal article from a journalist not even bothering at impartiality or hiding the jizz leaking out of his pants, and was narrowly focused on the guilt or innocence and crime of the person in question. Seriously, you are missing the forest for the trees. This was not normal. It wasn&#39;t normal for tens of thousands of people to drive in by train and crowd around the platform and watch. This kind of coverage of the incident, was not normal. Reading it is frankly entirely surreal in retrospect. So public, shameless, out in the open lynchings of blacks exploded all over the south, they were widely attended social gatherings. It was <em>not</em> a traditional southern practice before that time, contrary to many people&#39;s notions.</p>

<p>At first many southern governors, like even white supremacists, were taken aback by the sudden introduction of mass popular violence, and opposed it, because they were law and order types who disliked the lack of process. One Georgia governor who opposed lynchings was for the duration of the rest of his term constantly mailed pieces of people who had been lynched, as a joke, because his position was considered laughable. Anyway these politicians were largely replaced in short order.</p>

<p>The practice only abated somewhat after controversy over actual pictures of a particularly brutal lynching in the 1910s where someone was burned alive. The people who actually took these pictures did so largely because they wanted momentos. But actually seeing the violence of people smiling in front of the charred remains shocked the nation and caused a lot of pushback. After this point lynchings largely receded because southerners realized that it was making them look bad. </p>

<p>Two of the last lynchings in the nation took place in the county in which I grew up.</p>

<p>The early 20th century saw the south completely rewrite the history books with the Lost Cause narrative. People all over the nation were sympathetic to this largely garbage account that cast the south as some sympathetic victim, you had films like Birth of the Nation. Seriously, just go read the summary of Birth of a Nation, it makes me want to vomit. This was Woodrow Wilson&#39;s favorite film. This is actually pretty much what started the KKK. Like the actual original KKK was more or less dead by the late 1860s, it was an insurgency crushed by the federal forces. The modern KKK and all its predecessors was basically just fanboys of Birth of a Nation larping.</p>

<p>The 1900&#39;s also saw people literally importing &quot;savage&quot; races from colonies and setting up human zoos, they put a pygmy in a human zoo, an entire tribe of Filipino aboriginals. There was moral indignation, largely from pastors and religious groups, but this was largely mocked in the press, which was largely taken by scientific racist notions and considered it ridiculous that anyone could consider a pygmy as a human being and not some lesser species.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, we passed an immigration law that more or less restricted immigration to northwest europeans, because we were worried about the racial inferiority of Jews and Polacks and Italians immigrating at the time. When Coolidge signed this, he is said to have proclaimed &quot;Let&#39;s keep America American!&quot; This was the slogan of the larp KKK fyi. The 20s also saw forced sterilization programs. Which literally gave the power to just forcibly sterilize people without trial who hadn&#39;t committed any crime, and was found constitutional somehow.</p>

<p>It was only after we won WWII and saw the excesses of that period that there was a serious pushback. It&#39;s not a mistake that Brown vs. Board of Education passed after WWII. There is no way it could have passed before.</p>

The Tiger I was an engineering marvel so complicated that only a couple of thousand could be produced in seven years. The Panzer IV was a tank that had been good a decade ago but was both outclassed and massively outproduced by the T-34. The Panther was basically the Germans trying to make their own T-34 after getting pwned by them early on and still overengineering things because they can&#39;t help themselves. And none were even delivered until 1943, like lmao, the battle of stalingrad had already happened, Hitler was just stalling his suicide at that point, it was pointless.</p>

<p>The T-34 was dead simple to produce. It was unreliable and would fall apart in a month but it wasn&#39;t expected to last that long in battle anyway and by the time it did you&#39;d have a dozen more shipped in in its place. It concentrated on all the things it had to to help them win the war, it was reliable as it needed to be to last its estimated service life, and not a second longer, it ignored everything that wasn&#39;t necessary.</p>

<p>The American Shermans were better overall and the Soviets definitely preferred them quality wise when they had them available. But they were only delivered I think by 1944.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They eventually capitulated to the idea that modern physics was necessary for building an atom bomb.</p>

<p>Most of their reputation of high technology came from propaganda and premature deployment of other technologies. Like, the Nazis never hesitated to deploy half-baked technology as they started to lose.</p>

<p>The propaganda had a lasting effect on German language. Their term for &quot;wonder weapon,&quot; which the Nazis often used seriously, is now used to refer to something that doesn&#39;t or won&#39;t live up to high expectations.</p>
