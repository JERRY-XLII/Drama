<hr/>

<p>Tries to iniatiate revenge sex by consoling the girl Chad just cheated on, and it works, but he&#39;s too drunk (or coomer) to even get it up. Then at night he tries to initiate sex with the girl Chad cheated with (and also just before dumped a load in) and gets denied.</p>

<p>End of the story:<br/>
- Chad cheats on his gf twice with a friend of hers, but they stay together and she gives him the high-ground after all of it, because she kissed and almost had sex with the azncel<br/>
- Azncel gets dabbed on for the entire night, gets dabbed on by the girls complaining to the school, gets dabbed on by the school suspending him, gets dabbed on by the Obama administration allowing the school to just #believewomen, gets dabbed on by his retarded lawyer</p>

<p>It&#39;s over for sneaky ugloids.</p>

<p>both were drunk, she seemingly consented and kissed back.
I wonder, why is it that when women are drunk and have sex, they get a pass, yet when men do it they are rapists? </p>

<p>That wasn’t the problem.</p>

<p>The problem was he later went back home with the throuple, tried to climb into bed with that girl when she was passed out and had already got back with the other guy she had been pining for the entire time (Harry).  And then he also tried to hook up with the other girl after failing with the first twice.</p>

<p>Clearly Harry was the chad here, he just drank too much booze</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair critique</p>

<p>I think that women have a reasonable expectation to not be kissed and brought to a stairwell to have sex, or have someone sneak into their bed and try to sex them</p>

<p>Then again, it s hard to enforce this when theres so much alcogol </p>

<p><strong>If you have drunken sex with a foid, literally the next morning preemptively accuse her of sexual assault.</strong></p>

<p>This gives you the best chance of survival in case she decides a few years down the road she was abused.</p>
