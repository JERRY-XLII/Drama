    <div class="md"><p>Yes! Now you’re finally starting to get it! Guess what? WE WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE TOO!</p>

<p>But NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. </p>

<p>You wanted “equality”. You wanted all the high powered jobs but you didn’t want to dig a ditch to get there and THAT wasn’t enough. </p>

<p>No - you had to go make shit up. Then ALL MEN WERE EVIL. Remember ‘smashing Herero-normativity?’ Remember ‘Kill all men’ memes? </p>

<p>We fucking do! </p>

<p>Remember the ‘I bathe in male tears’ tumblr bullshit? </p>

<p>We fucking do! </p>

<p>Remember women needing men like fish need a bicycle? </p>

<p>WE FUCKING DO!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>GET WRECKT!! Looks like Karma’s got a ladydick and it ain’t gonna suck itself now IS IT????</p>

<p>We TOLD you this would happen but NOOOOOOOOO you fucking knew better!!!! How’s that Gloria Steinem working out for ya? Read any Valeria Soleras lately? How bout some Andrea Dworkin? How’s that working out for ya? How is 70 fucking years of man-hating rhetoric and lies feel coming right back at ya?</p>

<p>Who’s the bigot now, bitch? Oh you suck on that lady dick long and hard transphobe! You suck it and you LIKE it or else maybe someone calls YOUR employer and tells them YOURE A FUCKING BIGOT when the truth is, you just wanted FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION. You didn’t have a problem minding their own business it’s just when they FORCED their opinions on you. </p>

<p>What’s that? You want to play softball without ‘men’ in your dressing room? Guess what, they ain’t men anymore, darlin’. That’s a huuuuuuge clit and you’re a sexist racist bigot if you don’t agree. </p>

<p>No the DSMIV that you rainbow sprite advocates fucking lobbied to change on political grounds rather than medical says they’re women now. Have fun never winning an Olympic medal again much less a participation trophy bEcAuSe ThErE’s No DiFfErEnCe BeTwEeN mEn AnD WoMeN nOw! We’re just whatever fucking gender we want with NO RULES and NO BOUNDARIES. </p>

<p>What’s that? You want a physical barrier to keep the bad men out? WALLS ARE RACIST KAREN!! Take your WHITE FEMINIST TEARS OUTSIDE! THIS is an INCLUSIVE space!!</p>

<p>But hey, you’re a strong independant woman who don’t need a man’s help for anything! Who run da world????? You do! Slay queen! You go girl!Bicycles don’t help fish fix their fucking problems now do they????? DOOOO THEEEEEYYYYY????</p>

<p>Remember ‘the future is female?’ Well welcome to the future YOU FUCKING CREATED!!!!!! ALL WITHOUT THE HELP OF MEN!!!!!!! </p>

<p>AHHHHHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA</p>

<p>Oh you want to be ‘left alone?’ Well, I want pedophiles to leave kids alone but nope, now we have to have DRAG QUEEN STORY HOUR WITH REGISTERED PEDOS ALL HIDING UNDER THE STUNNING AND BRAVE RAINBOW FLAG!!!</p>

<p>SO FIGURE IT THE FUCK OUT ON YOUR OWN, SWEETHEART, BECAUSE NOW MEN WANT TO BE LEFT THE FUCK ALONE TOO! </p>

<p>Oh! And the realization about mass Muslim immigration hasn’t even DAWNED on you yet! You’ll be sucking that lady-dick as you’re BOTH hurled off the nearest 7-story+ building! Oh you’ll finally make it to that corner office all right, that’s the window they’ll throw you out of! Oh god I can’t stop laughing. You’re fucking priceless!</p>

<p>Well done! Well done indeed. For the life of me I can’t figure out why there hasn’t been a single civilization in history run by women. They seem so forward thinking, so, oh what’s the word... progressive. How could they not have anticipated such ‘unforeseen’ circumcisions, er, circumstances!! Oh god you could get DRAFTED to go fight the coming religious/civil wars!!!! AHHHHHHH!! </p>

<p>YOU ACHIEVED EQUALITY!!!! Now you’re every bit a bigoted as straight white men! Oh Karen you are so fucked and you’re only just now starting to realize it. God I would kill to see the look on your face when you realize everything you’ve been taught is a lie and you’ve been the useful idiot pawn of a globalist cabal of elitists! Just out of curiosity, how much credit card debt do you have? Do you live in a ‘vibrant inclusive urban center’? Got any land Karen? Know how to grow a fucking tomato, Karen if the lights go out? Think anyone is going to like you besides a bunch of hateful harridan harpies that beat their intimate partners at three times the rate gay men do? Are your cats going to save you from the collapse Karen????</p>

<p>But hey, at least one month out of the year you get to run around a street in a rainbow tutu screaming about how girl power Beyoncé is. For now. </p>

<p>Happy Pride. Enjoy your hollow consumer culture as you buff your Subaru chugging Starbucks and kvetching about how unfair your life is on whatever Apple product (built by child slave labor but hey, they’re only a bundle of cells) you use to menstruate your opinion with onto the Internet. </p>

<p>We said, Cool, to marriage equality even though it’s a joke. No one discriminated against you. You crybullied your way into every facet of American life on the backs of a false narrative of oppression and now those chickens have come home to roost. Wait, that’s not right. Those COCKS came home to roost! </p>

<p>now you get to learn about reciprocity. See, Karen, if you has a dick you’d know if you’re gonna fuck someone in the ass, you better give them a reach around. Ain’t that right TERF. TERFCEL! Ahhhhhh! </p>

<p>We offered mutual respect. You chose mutually assured destruction. </p>

<p>What’s the saying again? Pride goeth before a fall?</p>

<p>Enjoy that rainbow coupon from Budweiser! You earned that drink discount what with all your hard work.</p>
