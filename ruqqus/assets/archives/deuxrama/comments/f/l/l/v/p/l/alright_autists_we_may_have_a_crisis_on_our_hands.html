<p>With the world halting for a pandemic many people are starting to believe that that we may be in the end times. I obviously hope this is untrue but as your constituent I urge you to take swift action to prevent a possible extreme health crisis beyond the current Coronavirus one. This has to do with the anti-vaxxer movement, the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; and certain biomarkers people like Bill Gates are promoting. This is a secular argument, not a religious one. But it does take into account how certain religious groups will behave.</p>

<p>Bill Gates has already floated the idea of making a digital identification system to keep track of those who get the eventual Coronavirus vaccine. Microsoft and MIT developed &quot;tattoo markers&quot; that show whether you have recieved a vaccine or not. This may be coupled with Gate&#39;s new invention, ID2020, which would result in a digital ID microchip implanted under the skin.</p>

<p><a href="https://id2020.org/">https://id2020.org/</a></p>

<p>Now, there are around 100 million evangelical Christians in the United States and 600 million worldwide that believe the following biblical passage will literally occur:  </p>

<p>&quot;16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.&quot;</p>

<p>-- Revelation 13:16-17</p>

<p>Among these hundreds of millions of evangelical Christians, a huge number of them have had it drilled into them that the &quot;mark of the beast&quot; is a sign of the endtimes and will probably take the form of some sort of chip or biomarker without which societal ostracizing would occur. They commonly believe that if they were to get this &quot;mark of the beast&quot; their very soul would be imperiled. If this quantum dot technology is pushed through with the Coronavirus vaccine (or any vaccine, really) we are looking at an EXPLOSION in the number of people who become anti-vaxxers. This would create a national health risk that will destroy our national herd immunity and threaten millions of immunocompromised Americans, many of whom who are poor, people of color or LGBT+. These evangelicals aren&#39;t people you are going to be able to &quot;de-convert&quot; in any swift period of time. Nor are you going to be able to wash over this &quot;mark of the beast&quot; idea with any propaganda campaign. That would only embolden them and convince them that they&#39;re right. These aren&#39;t people you are going to be able to socially shame into getting vaccines through social or conventional media because they largely either don&#39;t use social media or have entirely separate media ecosystems. Despite how much it may disgust or seem silly to certain people by far the easiest and most humane solution here is to NOT ASSOCIATE VACCINES WITH ANY KIND OF IMPLANTED MARK. You can call people fundies, irresponsible, evil or whatever but the most surefree way to diminish human suffering and death is not to let this become a thing. You don&#39;t want evangelicals to &quot;phase-shift&quot; into end times holy war mode. And complaining about it on Social Media won&#39;t stop that if this goes through. Additionally even if this were only in third world countries, there are huge evangelical populations across the world who would take this as sure signs of the end times. In no way does this not end in either bloodshed or extreme totalitarian human rights abuses.</p>

<p>Please publicly oppose any implanted bio-markers even being implemented in the first place. Even if it&#39;s opt-in at first, it will create an environment where most people will eventually be forced to get it to participate in the social contract. For example, most of us carry a smartphone that can track our location constantly and we don&#39;t even bat an eye. This would have been unconscionable to the vast majority of people even a generation ago. If this becomes an opt-in vaccination option this will only serve to divide this country as non-evangelicals take the mark and evangelicals don&#39;t. This will create and embolden religious extremists.  Also, we need to turn back the tide in the War on Privacy, not give even more privacy rights away to totalitarian megacorporations who don&#39;t share our values.</p>

<p>Again we&#39;re talking about evangelical christians and easily tens of millions of Americans (at least) who will believe this no matter what. The problem with opt-in (besides the slippery slope) is that it associates this &quot;mark&quot; with vaccines which will still cause an explosion in anti-vaxxers. I am telling you that this is what people in the evangelical world are talking about and what they believe. This is the real world. You don&#39;t get to have a bunch of &quot;rational&quot; actors. If you care more about lessening suffering than moral platitudes then preventing this vaccination biomarker thing from happening is the clear morally right decision.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is not a call to be against vaccines in the first place. Vaccines have saved countless lives and it&#39;s important to not make vaccines a political or religious issue, for the sake of the immunocompromised. This is specifically just a call against privacy-infringing biomarkers regarding whether a person has taken a vaccine. Do not let this crisis become even worse.</p>

<p>At worst by speaking out against this you are protecting our right to privacy and quelling some silly misguided religious notions of many Americans. At best you are preventing another religious war which will cost human lives and American tax dollars. Our administration&#39;s slow response on the Coronavirus crisis is resulting in many needless deaths. We have a duty to nip this crisis in the bud. Please seriously consider this.</p>

<p>Also as your constituent, I urge you to reject the EARN IT Act (S. 3398) as it infringes on our right to privacy by infringing on certain types of end-to-end encryption.</p>
