        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t give a fuck, you know, whatever car you have, fucking apartments, fucking yachts whatever, I don&#39;t give a fuck, even &quot;Bentley&quot;, fucking &quot;Maybach&quot;, even &quot;Rolls-Royce&quot;, &quot;Bugatti&quot;, even 300-feet yacht, I don&#39;t give a shit, do you understand?</p>

<p>Whoever you are fucking, what whores, luxury escorts, whatever fucking space you are going to, I don&#39;t give a shit, ok? I&#39;m fucking so imbued in my knowledge, it&#39;s like I exist already one hundred trillion of billion years, I fucking live on billions and billions of planets like this, you know like this Earth, this world is absolutely obvious to me and I only seek one fucking thing - peace, tranquility and that harmony of unity with eternal infinity from contemplation of the great fractal semblance and this amazing unity of existence, eternal infinity wherever you look, like deep - infinitely small, high - infinitely huge, you know? </p>

<p>Go bustle about, it&#39;s your direction, your way and your horizon of knowledge, feeling and your nature, it&#39;s infinitely shallow in comparison to mine, you know? I&#39;m like a wise old man, immortal or almost immortal, who was at this planet since its inception, when the Sun has started to form as a star and started to from these coacervates, planets, you know? It&#39;s like I live on this fucking Earth five billion years, I fucking know it all, all this world and you are telling me that shit... I don&#39;t give a fuck about your cars, your fucking yachts, your apartments... your wealth. I was on this planet and on infinite amount of and I was greater than Caesar and greater than Hitler and greater than greatest, I was, you understand? And somewhere I was a pathetic shit even worse than now. I feel myriads of these states. Somewhere I&#39;m more like a plant, somewhere more like a bird, like worm, somewhere just a piece of stone, it&#39;s all the soul, you know? It has edges of semblance absolutely different, infinite amount of them. But you can&#39;t understand so get the fuck out. We live in this world with different feelings, different goals so we are in different places and we have different directions as well. I wish you to have the newest cars and the best females spreading legs before you, all their holes inside out, like a fucking carpet and you would fuck them until you are blue, red like a dawn sun, you would fly on the best planes and cum  from the plane window and whatever you can and can not imagine. If you run out of ideas, let me know I will give hundreds of trillion ideas for every your idea, I&#39;ll tell you what to do.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for me though, I&#39;m like a wise old man, who has seen eternal, who touched by the God, who became god-like and directed to the eternity and who resides in peace, tranquility, harmony, grace, innermost enjoyment, reunited with everyone and everything, you know? This is it, this is our difference. So I&#39;m going to admire the Creation and you are going to be imbued in some EDGES, that&#39;s it, you know? You don&#39;t see the eternal infinity, you don&#39;t need it but you are kind of more active like a knocking woodpecker or an ant, who is a very active in their inclination and that&#39;s it. So our ways here kind of, you know, obviously they have some semblance, because of unity of everything but I understand you very well and you probably don&#39;t understand me, because it&#39;s like I contain you, all your nature, it makes an infinitesimal particle of what I am, so go fuck yourself and I will go to enjoy a fucking spring dawn on the banks of a warm southern river. Okay, go fuck yourself and I&#39;ll do the same.</p>
