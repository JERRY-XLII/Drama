    <div class="md"><p>Honestly it is pathetic that you would go start a whole different thread just to try to show off and get people to agree with you and tell you how right you were. You were aggressive with me for no reason at all and it is clear that you were in the wrong. Now yet again others are confirming this to be true. Yet you insist on denying reality. You struggle on through your delusions of grandeur. I feel bad for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, alright, I got my jollies so let&#39;s simmer down. Honestly though, why do you like to browse DeuxRAMA? This is kinda a troll sub and you seem genuinely surprised to see such banter. What brought you to this sub in the first place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I browse numerous parts of the Internet, as you would have discovered in my initial post if you had taken the time to read it and think about it rather than resorting to calling me names and mocking me. </p>

<p>I have several friends specifically who invited me to check out DeuxRama however and when I first started browsing it was a very friendly community full of people with original thoughts and worldviews. It has certainly taken a much more hateful turn in the last several weeks.</p>

<p>I suspect that those who are quarantined at home who usually would bully other children, say at the mall or perhaps in their High School,  have been forced from the precipice of reality over into the realms of Virtual Reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I&#39;m gonna pause on being a troll for a second to let you know I think people are pulling your leg. This sub is for drama, shitposts, and just general discourse. Someone here recommended that you sell your nudes on a gay dating app. No surprise that dudes just wanted to see that peen. That guy was obviously just pulling your leg.</p>

<p>Feel free to stick around, but don&#39;t be so surprised when some retard calls you a faggot here. And no, this sub has always been bum fucking retarded, even before the quarantine.</p>

<p>Do you have some form of autism? Not even trying to poke fun. You just genuinely seem oblivious to everything happening around you. Maybe r/wholesome would be more your speed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only person around here I do not Trust so far is you. It seems as if you do not want me here and I cannot Understand why. All I am doing is standing up for myself. You could not possibly scare me away from here although I am certain you would love to see that. You are going to pause on being a Troll? This is your life: think about it.</p>

<p>Why does everyone seem to think I am autistic? People have asked me before. I have told them This: I have been to numerous doctors throughout my life, more than most people will ever See, and in all of those visits I have never been Diagnosed with Autism.</p>

<p>Anyways, Thank You for the subreddit recommendation, I had not heard of that one before.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, whether you want to trust that I&#39;m telling you the truth about this sub or not is irrelevant. It says in the sub description &quot;The future of intellectual discourse.&quot; This is a drama sub that was initially meant to make fun of r/drama meta. People here are actively encouraged to find/create/post drama.</p>

<p>Someone even managed to get you to attempt to solicite your nudes on a gay dating app. That&#39;s the kind of &quot;discourse&quot; that is encouraged here. It&#39;s all for laughs, and the humor here is often at the expense someone such as yourself.</p>

<p>Whoever recommended this sub to you either didn&#39;t explain it well to you, or they knew that you&#39;d be oblivious to what is happening here. </p>

<p>And no, that doesn&#39;t surprise me that people have asked you before if you are autistic. You seem to be very naive as if you genuinely believe &quot;no, people wouldn&#39;t lie on the internet. That guy who told me to sell nudes on grindr just had some bad information.&quot;</p>

<p>I read the comments. That guy knew what he was doing.</p>

<p>I only came at you calling you a faggot because I figured you were another bumbling retard who frequents this sub. I thought your post was a shitpost. I didn&#39;t realize you&#39;d get all offended and pissy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are really starting to hurt my feelings. I am feeling a little panicked now. I have talked to a lot of people since I found out about this Place and they were all very nice to me and seemed interested in the stories I told. I thought I was being a good contributor because the rules say for whatever, so I figured talking about my Life fits into that category. </p>

<p>And now you want to tell me that everyone was secretly making fun of me? I do not believe it, I think you have it mixed up. I know that people Lie on the Internet, I am not as naive as you might think. But I have a good sense for these kinds of things and you are the only person who does not seem happy to talk with me.</p>

<p>I think the person who told me to sell those videos meant well. Everyone is struggling right now, it just didn&#39;t Work out for me. It does not mean he was trying to mess with me.</p>

<p>I am not offended, I am a thick-skinned Individual but I will admit what you have said hurts. I was really beginning to feel welcomed Here. In fact, people send me private messages often just to tell me how Interested they are in my story. They ask me for advice and they ask me how my days were. And now you say they are all making fun of me? It does not add up if you ask me.</p>
