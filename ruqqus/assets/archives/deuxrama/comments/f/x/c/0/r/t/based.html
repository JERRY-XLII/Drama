    <div class="md"><p>Please, I know everyone’s extremely upset. I’ve poured tons of time, money, phone banking, etc into the Bernie campaign. We all wanted this so badly and it NEEDED to happen, but please, vote for Joe when all is said and done.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is legitimately the worst, most corrupt piece of shit, barely human being to ever take the position of the president. If we don’t vote or vote third party we are doing Trump a favor. He’ll more than likely get another ONE, or potentially in the worst case scenario TWO Supreme Court picks if he wins again. Say goodbye to abortion rights, say goodbye to any justice at all. The country will be the closest thing to a dictatorship we’ve ever seen. 
If these last four years haven’t convinced you to vote against Trump I don’t think anything ever will, and we’ll continue to suffer as a country because our guy didn’t win, and we won’t accept any other option. Bernie himself will endorse Joe Biden and beg us to vote for him because he knows damn well that the alternative is extremely dangerous to the fabric of what little democracy we have left.</p>

<p>At least if Joe wins we can put the pressure on him every day, hold him accountable for every little thing, and push him as far left as we can. He’ll have no choice if the people are constantly up his ass. Let’s face it, we were all very complacent with Obama and rarely held him accountable for anything. We can do this with Joe but can we at least PLEASE tip toe in the right direction and not further into a full blown catastrophe with Trump. 
The world itself is legitimately relying on us to get Trump the fuck out of office and get his ass in jail. Enough is enough. Please vote, please please vote. And if you’re not gonna vote or you’re going to vote third party, then you may as well put a check mark next to Trumps name instead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He ran a bunch of bad boys. And I did and back in those days – to show how things have changed – one of the things you had to use, if you used Pomade in your hair, you had to wear a baby cap. And so he was up on the board and wouldn’t listen to me. I said, ‘Hey, Esther, you! Off the board, or I’ll come up and drag you off.’ Well, he came off, and he said, ‘I’ll meet you outside.’</p>

<p>My car this – was mostly, these were all public housing behind us,” Biden continued. “My car – there was a gate on here. I parked my car outside the gate. And I – and he said, ‘I’ll be waiting for you. He was waiting for me with three guys with straight razors. Not a joke. There was a guy named Bill Wright Mouse the only white guy and he did all the pools. He was a mechanic. And I said, ‘What am I gonna do?’ And he said. ‘Come down here in the basement, where mechanics – all the mechanics- – where all the pool builder is.’ You know the chain, there used to be a chain that went across the deep end. And he cut off a six-foot length of chain, and folded it up and he said, ‘You walk out with that chain, and you walk to the car and say, ‘you may cut me man, but I’m gonna wrap this chain around your head.’</p>

<p>I said, ‘You’re kidding me.’ He said, ‘No if you don’t, don’t come back.’ And he was right. So I walked out with the chain. And I walked up to my car. And in those days, you remember the straight razors, you had to bang ’em on the curb, gettin’ em rusty, puttin’ em in the rain barrel, gettin’ em rusty? And I looked at him, but I was smart, then. I said, ‘First of all,’ I said, ‘when I tell you to get off the board, you get off the board, and I’ll kick you out again, but I shouldn’t have called you Esther Williams, and I apologize for that. I apologize.’ But I didn’t know that apology was gonna work.</p>

<p>He said, ‘you apologize to me?&#39;” Biden went on. “I said, ‘I apologize but not for throwing you out, but I apologize for what I said.’ He said, ‘OK,’ closed that straight razor, and my heart began to beat again.</p>
