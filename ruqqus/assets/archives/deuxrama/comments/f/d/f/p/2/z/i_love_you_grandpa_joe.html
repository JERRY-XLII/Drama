    <div class="md"><p>Ok, maybe I should save this for tomorrow, but I am so fucking devastated right now. Jesus fucking Christ, the fact that Biden has any chance, let alone being the predicted nominee at this point is absurd.</p>

<p>Remember when it seemed for a while that Roy Moore was going to lose the Alabama Senate race to a democrat, because he&#39;s a fucking paedophile, but then to the surprise of all the liberals who thought Republicans still had decency, it turned out that they&#39;re completely willing to stand behind our guy.</p>

<p>Well congrats democrats on proving yourselves no fucking better. Congrats on proving that you&#39;re willing to elect someone whose behaviour around women is comparable to that of Jimmy fucking Saville. Congrats on proving that some borderline dementia patient who stands for absolutely nothing, and probably isn&#39;t even sane enough to run for president is your choice.</p>

<p>But y&#39;know, every democratic darling was completely unfit for presidency. National Service Pete, aka mr &quot;I get funding from the state department and CIA, and will likely bomb and coup any country I&#39;m told to&quot;, Bloomberg, for whom apparently stop and frisk programs are &quot;discriminatory towards whites&quot; because in his vision of a world your skin colour is a crime(Who has 40 outstanding sexual harassment cases by the way, because systemic rape and misogyny is what our entire civilisation is built on). Biden was the tip of the fucking iceberg for these people.</p>

<p>In any sane democracy, the fact that there&#39;s any chance of two sex-pests barely able to form coherent sentences running against each other would be absurd.</p>

<p>The so called &quot;Moderate Democrat&quot; is a hate-driven ideological extremist who will rally behind their fashy leaders just the same as the alt-right. They try and smear us as hateful extremists and ideologues because it&#39;s sheer projection. They know full well they have no conviction, an inability to compromise, and hate for anyone who disagrees with them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s well known that fascists have a tendency to fall in line behind their leaders right and wrong because they&#39;re driven more by hate and insecurity in their position on social hierarchy. Well congrats on proving yourselves as fascists, you liberal scumbags. You&#39;ve proven that you hate us leftists so much that you will rally behind Joe Fucking Biden, who is by all metrics the most incompetent leader you could, just to spite us and to maintain your fucking starbucks lattes and wall street yuppie jobs.</p>

<p>The far-left on the other hand splinters itself a hundred times over minor ideological differences. Do you know why?, Because we actually fucking care, we actually believe in something. We&#39;re the ones who are willing to compromise on our positions out of pragmatism, we&#39;re the ones who are willing</p>

<p>I&#39;m sick and fucking tired of the sheer vitriol and hate I get for being one of the few ACTUALLY moderate people out here. Because the far-left IS the moderate, yet every single time I try and compromise my position and rally behind a candidate half-way between my beliefs and the status quo, I get treated like an invader whose destroying your parties from the inside, and responsible for all your problems.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fucking tired of the vitriol liberals have towards leftists, to the extent that they&#39;ll back Joe Biden just to fucking spite us, blame us on their inevitable loss to Trump, claim w&#39;ere invading THEIR party that they apparently have a god-given right to maintain as the status quo, and treating us like toxic trash to be discarded because we don&#39;t support the murder of Yemeni children, or people dying from lack of healthcare.</p>

<p>You know whose going to win this election if it comes between Biden and Trump?, Saudi Arabia. Because our only chance of having a president who actually wants world peace will be fucking ruined.</p>

<p>Dear Liberals, Dear Biden Voters: You may start noticing that you&#39;re being haunted by the ghosts of dead Yemeni children, bombed in the ongoing total war waged by Saudi Arabia which makes no distinction between civilians and military personnel.</p>

<p>Any future wars in the Middle East are your fault. Our continued support of Saudi Arabia in their genocidal campaign will be your fault. The next refugee crisis will be your fault. That&#39;s what you get for not voting for peace. You get bombed children.</p>

<p>As a pacifist, I have to say: I fucking hate all of you. All of you are as bad as George W fucking Bush. The CIA are going to keep building up unlimited, unquestioned power to terrorise American citizens with, countries you can&#39;t even point out on a map will get invaded.</p>

<p>Enjoy the slow decline in to tyranny that the US has been facing for decades now. Hope you enjoy being spied on by the NSA. And when the time finally comes that all the war and poverty and climate disaster is too much, and the National Guard start arresting dissidents on the street, because of the unchecked power of authoritarian warmongers is what causes all that fucking shit: You could have stopped this, but instead you chose to be fascists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You absolute numbskull, you bumbling idiot, none of the constant dribble that has came out of the word spewer you call a mouth has made any sense in the slightest. I hate you and everything you stand for, you fucking devolved orangutan wasting everyones time. Instead of constantly spewing nonsense, pick up a book and learn something, you IDIOT. I have never met someone that&#39;s as much as an absolute CRETIN as you. You are a childish and idiotic excuse for a human, you absolute fucking idiotic, brainless, believes everything people tell you, BUFFOON.</p>
