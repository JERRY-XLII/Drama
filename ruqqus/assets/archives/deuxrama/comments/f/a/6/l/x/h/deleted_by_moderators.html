    <div class="md"><p>So long as non-straights everywhere aren&#39;t fearing for their lives and aren&#39;t committing suicide and living miserable lives because of the insane discrimination and hatred they face....then NO, sadly, there are gonna be lots of straight people who simply don&#39;t feel like they have any power, sadly</p>

<p>I saw a Dennis Prager comment that was strangely relevant to your question (I have been looking for it for five minutes but I can&#39;t locate it - but I read it a week or two ago), they quoted him in some news article basically saying:</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, conservatives own the courts, all three branches of government, and most state legislatures, and sure most CEOs are conservatives...but liberals own popular culture and that&#39;s where the REAL power is&quot; (paraphrased, obviously)</p>

<p>I thought that was a pretty instructive comment if you want to understand US conservatives/right-wingers and their relationship to institutional power. According to one of their rhetorical luminaries, having nearly ALL control of the government at every level, and control of most corporations. IS NOT ENOUGH. What they want is NOT JUST control over all bodies of both government and commerce, but also they want popular culture to be dominated, controlled, policed, and regulated by conservatives, and if popular culture isn&#39;t totally dominated by conservatives, then these conservatives are gonna mope around feeling like they&#39;re under seige, they&#39;re gonna act like put-upon underdogs just trying to catch a break.</p>

<p>So yeah....these guys don&#39;t FEEL like they have power. They have ALL the power that actually matters, literally like 90% of it, but what they REALLY want is for Rush Limbaugh to be as universally beloved as Mr. Rogers. For Alex Jones to be as beloved as Will Smith. For InfoWars to be as beloved as Star Wars, etc. and they feel like the very existence of liberals is the only thing keeping the culture from being where they want it to be.</p>

<p>So the next step, naturally, would be for conservatives - who we&#39;ve already established hold pretty much all the ACTUAL power in the US - to start using the power they have to take whatever steps are necessary to make that happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I’ve met people like this, in real life. They truly never measure up in anything they do. They can’t maintain eye contact, they don’t ever really accomplish anything, this is his only outlet because he’s too spineless, weak, and awkward to do anything else. He goes from sub to sub crying about some kind of criminal high fantasy as if anyone would ever notice him in real life. Someone’s probably bullying him as we speak lmao.</p>
