        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is this the advanced response that your superior, free system can muster?</p>

<p>You know China already has the virus contained pretty much. We&#39;re apparently just going to let it run its course though because Trump is worried about stock prices and the election.</p>

<p>Hope that prayer helps you out though. Good thing America quarantined itself from China so that we can&#39;t spread it back to them! The Chinese people are thankful for your selfless sacrifice!</p>

<p>The EU travel ban is laughable! Especially exempting your buddies in the UK when it&#39;s there too! This is what I feared when the travel bans began, it gives people a false sense of security. By the time we banned travel from China it was already seeded here, spreading, and would continue to grow exponentially. But we banned China, dusted our hands off, and were like, whelp that&#39;s done glad there&#39;s no problem anymore.</p>

<p>To ban the fucking EU so long after it&#39;s clearly established in the US itself, get a fucking clue! This is a thousand times less effective than even the China one, and yet he going to use it as an excuse to do nothing else! Just use the virus as an excuse to pursue his fanatical obsessive hatred of multilateral institutions, U(cuc)K is a good boy for doing our bidding and voting brexit though so they get an exemption and can continue infecting us all they want. Prayer, racism, and denial, America is such a shit country!</p>

<p>We need to take serious action to combat it in America, not keep on using it as an excuse to virtue signal and selectively punish your percieved global enemies who are just as fucked as you! When will America accept that it has problems within itself, it is not some utopia and all evil comes without?</p>

<p>The entire purpose of all this denial and blaming outsiders BTW was to keep the stock market up, how&#39;s that looking now? Trump seriously probably thought this would go off just like the China ban and shut people up, no you fucker, this looks desperate as fuck at this point and shows how clueless your are!</p>

<p>Travel bans do not work unless you&#39;re an island and ban the whole world from the beginning. They should never be a part of any global pandemic response again because they distract from effective disease prevention work, give people a false sense of security, and so aid in its spread, it moves to quickly and grows too exponentially, by the time you ban one country its already in another you haven&#39;t banned, then by the time you ban them its in your own. Once it&#39;s in your own, it will grow exponentially and run its course to the extent that your public health system is able to deal with it. </p>

<p>And all the energy you wasted on the bans you should&#39;ve been putting into preparation, you could have had a public health system prepared to combat it, but you thought a few bans would work and so did nothing at all on that front. You were manning the gates and the enemy is already within the walls. Just 5 COVD16 tests per million, compared to over 5000 for south Korea! We are less prepared than third world countries! Racism was the whole game plan apparently. </p>

<p>Instead of encouraging the world to band together against the disease, they encourage performative cruelty and put roadblocks in the way of the international community providing aid to the locations that most need it! We should have sent doctors to Wuhan, not banned them from traveling there! Everything bad about America came out in its response to the coronavirus, and it is paying for it. America will be the hardest hit country of it all, how many of you have it and don&#39;t even know it because your government doesn&#39;t want you to be tested, that would hurt the precious stock market numbers, it wants to hide the problem because it embarrasses your shitty system which is rotten and corrupted to its core and cannot deal with it! Hope you enjoy a Pence prayer though! </p>

<p>Praise Deng!</p>
