    <div class="md"><p>If the mods didn&#39;t want it in their thread, they could say that or just delete my posts. At this point you&#39;re just being childish, reaching desperately for some way to be right when you&#39;re so very wrong. You can keep trying, but you&#39;ve failed to make any progress thus far and won&#39;t unless you change your tactics. Repeatedly attacking my &quot;reading comprehension&quot; is just another sign you have no purpose here other than to try and offend me, which makes sense given what you&#39;re defending but won&#39;t actually get you anywhere, particularly when you&#39;re so wrong. Are you going to keep digging yourself into a deeper hole, or do you want to quit now?</p>

<p>do foids really expect men to take care of their bodies and try for a well paying job just so some day when they meet a femoid they see a future with, she won&#39;t be turned off by his lifestyle?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>foids and lack of self-awareness, are there closer linked facets of life?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck happens in American colleges? Like I know you have campuses which ate basically little cities with a median age of 20 so that can lead to some wild shit but the amount of ppl I see justify stuff by saying &quot;it was college&quot; is just ridiculous. </p>

<p>Also American colleges are just so ridiculously expensive, how can ppl even afford to throw that money away by not taking college seriously? 
Just study to get your degree instead of hoeing and ending up with 0 education and -100k in your bank account</p>

    <div class="md"><p>General rundown for US schools is this:<br/>
Preschool -&gt; kindergarten -&gt; elementary school (grades 1-5) -&gt; middle school (grades 6-8) -&gt; high school (grades 9-12) -&gt; college / university / trade school (Associates degree of any type and most trade apprenticeships are 2 years ), BA or BS degree is 4-5 years,  MA degree is 5-6 years, PhD is usually around 8 years but can go up to 10 years).<br/>
 Med School is also 8 years iirc that is tacked on after the first 4-5 for a pre-med B.S. or B.A. degree.  Law School has a similar system I think.<br/>
Most people in the workforce have a BS, BA or more.<br/>
Most people graduate high school when they are 18 years old.  college/Uni is therefore generally for people 18-24 with some older people there for a late education or a PhD program, and some younger high school students doing the running start program.<br/>
College/Uni is also the only one that you have to pay for; unless you are poor, homeless, super smart, play sports like a mofo, or something like that in which case gov&#39;t grants and scholarships (from gov&#39;t, schools, private institutions, companies, etc) have got your back.<br/>
Also some rich people pay for their kids to attend private schools, but that&#39;s mostly just an east coast (and maybe California) big city thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve got a feeling the text is gonna be gone, so I’ll just paste the clusterfuck down here:</p>

<p>Fiancé(30M) found out about my(28F) college days, hasn’t talked to me in 3 days. Idk if this is the end?</p>

<p>I’ve been with my fiancé for 2 years engaged for 2 months. I can go on and on about how great he is but I won’t waste your time. He’s awesome. </p>

<p>Him and my sisters boyfriend have gotten really close over the past year and they talk atleast twice a week whether on the phone or FaceTime or just hanging out with all 4 of us. </p>

<p>Sister has been with her boyfriend since high school so obviously her boyfriend knows me very well. As well as my dating history.</p>

<p>Last weekend bc of the quarantine we all thought it would be fun to drink and hang out over FaceTime. It was a FaceTime double date and we all had a blast. Laughing, playing drinking games, we all partied for over an hour and that’s when I was over it and decided to leave the party to call my sister directly without the boys in another room. </p>

<p>Wel my fiancé and her boyfriend stayed on FaceTime and continued to get drunk together. During this time (I couldn’t hear shit bc I was in another room and was talking to my sister), sisters boyfriend goes and tells a bunch of stories about my college days and how many guys I hooked up with. </p>

<p>Just so everyone knows...idk the actual #. My first 3 years of college was literally one giant party. Without being too descriptive...I admit I was “excessive”. But at the time it was just what we did. I was single during that time and me and my friends...did a lot. With slot of guys. Most of them I couldn’t even pick out of a lineup. But again...I WAS IN COLLEGE!</p>

<p>Anyways, one of the parties I went to I ended up hooking up with 4 different guys at the same time. (This is relevant later)</p>

<p>My fiancé is handsome as fuck and I know for a fact he’s been with several women. We talked about our past a lot in the beginning of our relationship. I wasn’t 100% honest with mine and I can only assume that he was. </p>

<p>After everyone hung up, me and my fiancé were laying in bed and about to sleep when he just Calmly asked me
“Did you get gangbanged in college?”</p>

<p>My response was “wtf? Why would you ask that?”</p>

<p>That’s when he told me everything that my sisters bf told him. He told me details I’m not even sure are 100% true bc again...blur. But a lot of the info was accurate and so I just told him yes. It was one time. 
He continued asking questions about the other stuff but the “gangbang” thing kept coming up and he had ALOT of questions about it that I answered the best of my knowledge. </p>

<p>Fast forward to Wednesday...things had been fine and normal sun mon tue. But on Wednesday...radio silence. He hasn’t texted or talked to me in 3 days. The breaking point was tonight when he came home from work and he asked me </p>

<p>“Are you friends with any of the guys on Facebook?”</p>

<p>Again, not lying to him I admitted that yes I was friends with all of them. </p>

<p>He left a few hours ago and I have no idea where he is or what he’s doing. I’m tempted to call the cops but I feel like that will just make it worse. I feel like garbage. I fucking hate my sisters bf right now but maybe it’s not even his fault, maybe I shoulda been more honest? I’m so lost. He is the best thing to ever happen to me and I’ve never seen him like this before. Is this the end? He refuses to return my calls/texts.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>

<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>
