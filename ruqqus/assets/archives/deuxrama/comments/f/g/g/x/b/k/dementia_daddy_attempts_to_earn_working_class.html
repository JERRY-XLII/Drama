<p>This is called you being very stupid. They aren&#39;t going to make it legal to cross the border, they&#39;re trying to make it a lower level offense.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thirdway.org/memo/whats-the-impact-of-decriminalizing-border-crossings">https://www.thirdway.org/memo/whats-the-impact-of-decriminalizing-border-crossings</a></p>

<p>You&#39;re not understanding what they&#39;re saying. Likely because your brain is rotted with Trumpian propaganda.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the discussion about repeal of Section 1325 was seen as a pivotal moment in the debates, the truth is that repealing it would do very little. Taking Section 1325 off the books would not open American borders to uncontrolled immigration or grant the right to enter the country to anyone who wants it. It would simply mean those entering without authorization would be deported using the civil immigration process, rather than using the criminal system to first convict them for a low-level misdemeanor offense and then deport them.</p>

<p>Moreover, repealing this section would leave on the books the other crimes mentioned above. Castro’s proposal would still allow prosecution for re-entering the U.S. without authorization, as well as a myriad other offenses.10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All it would be mean is they&#39;re deported via the civil system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aight, i&#39;ll bite. The ownership has seen a decrease since last year. I&#39;ll accept that. But if you think you can win with 20% of the vote not being interested in your position on firearms, you can think again.  </p>

<p>If you think even dropping border crossing to a lower level offense is a winning position, you can think again.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure dropping it to deportation via the civil system would be any better. They&#39;d still be free to go about their business in the country before having to meet specific dates, and with no concrete information on the person, it&#39;d be hard to find them again.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m just going to put this here for the record: Biden or Bernie, provided Trump doesn&#39;t fuck up the Coronavirus, Trump wins. It&#39;s extremely fucking clear at this stage. Polling data showed Hillary had a HUGE favorability coming into the 2016 election. How did that work out for her? Trump had a huge surge in support for his primary. He&#39;s the fucking incumbent, nobody needs to vote for him. Voter turnout for the state caucuses has been as anemic as they were in 2016.  </p>

<p>Just seems to me like everything&#39;s coming up Trump. I like him for his meme factor but not much else, to be honest. I&#39;m sick of defending him. I&#39;d rather somebody like Jill Stein get in and see more libertarian policies introduced to defend freedoms and liberties and limit the powers of the government, but I don&#39;t get what I want.</p>

<p>So you were wrong, then? Furthermore, yes, you literally can win without those voters. There are more democrats in America than Republicans and indies agree more with dems on gun control than Republicans. The DNC needs not a single guntard vote.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Cite your sources. Show me your empirical data showing the majority of the country is against lowering the offense level. You already tried to lie and claim they wanted open borders, which took me 10 seconds to prove wrong.</p>

<p>This might blow your mind given you likely spend most of your time in right-wing circlejerks, but the vast majority of Americans are not cruel pieces of shit. Repealing the law simply takes it back to what it used to be, it&#39;s not some big adjustment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure dropping it to deportation via the civil system would be any better. They&#39;d still be free to go about their business in the country before having to meet specific dates, and with no concrete information on the person, it&#39;d be hard to find them again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vast majority of people show up to their court hearings. Well over 75%.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just going to put this here for the record: Biden or Bernie, provided Trump doesn&#39;t fuck up the Coronavirus, Trump wins. It&#39;s extremely fucking clear at this stage. Polling data showed Hillary had a HUGE favorability coming into the 2016 election. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where is your data supporting the claim Trump wins? Biden is out running Clinton with rural whites by double digit margins. Trump won 3 states by razor thin margins. If Biden does even 1% better with rural whites in those states - which is already the case, he will easily beat Donald Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump had a huge surge in support for his primary. He&#39;s the fucking incumbent, nobody needs to vote for him. Voter turnout for the state caucuses has been as anemic as they were in 2016.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Retards showing up to vote in an uncontested primary has no relevance to overall electoral support.  And turnout is up in pretty much every state, actually. over 40% in some cases.</p>
