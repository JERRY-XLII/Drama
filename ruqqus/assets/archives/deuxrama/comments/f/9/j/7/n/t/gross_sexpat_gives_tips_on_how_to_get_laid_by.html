<p>Taking advantage of less educated, less financially stable, less worldly women raised in a more restrictive third world culture looking for a way out is immoral. Not only that advertising this loophole to other men to also take advantage? I guess that‚Äôs how gang rapes exist. ‚Äú<em>Brah, I‚Äôm raping this passed out chick. You want to join in, bro?</em>‚Äù Just ugh. It‚Äôs like do you even see women as human beings?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit! Not JUST sexist and racist, but ableist too? God damn! You‚Äôre like the unholy trifecta of concern trolling, western-centric assholery!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not ‚Äúso overweight.‚Äù I was. Over two years ago. Then I lost over a hundred lbs through hard work, diet, and exercise. I‚Äôm still in the process of hitting my goal weight of 170lbs (for a guy who is 5‚Äô11‚Äù), but I got roughly 20 lbs to go. So ‚Äúso overweight‚Äù is just a bunch of bullshit. </p>

<p>As for ‚Äúdisabled,‚Äù I have narcolepsy with cataplexy. It‚Äôs a sleep disorder, and does not in any way affect my physical appearance or really much about my interpersonal relationships. It DOES make me a MASSIVE worker‚Äôs comp risk, and therefore the government doesn‚Äôt feel in employable, but yeah, very little affect on my ‚Äúdate-ability‚Äù unless all you‚Äôre interested in is my ability to earn dollar dollar bills.</p>

<p>But yeah, you thinking that everyone in Asia is ‚Äúless fortunate‚Äù and that they can‚Äôt make intelligent decisions for themselves? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs really disgusting here.</p>

<p>Stop using western centric like a babbling idiot. I‚Äôm not from the west. I don‚Äôt think everyone in Asia is less fortunate but I‚Äôve been keeping tabs on this for years and years now and I know the all sorts of disturbing exploitation of women and children that goes in certain Asian countries.

<p>You assuming that Asia is some how so dramatically inferior to the west and that the women in Asia are somehow all helpless does waiting to be victimized by the mean ol‚Äô white man is REALLY telling as to how you actually feel about women and non-westerners.</p>

<p>Can you stop assuming who I am with identity politics and putting me in a box?</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have poor views of Asians. I‚Äôm just outwardly spoken about the exploitation of women and children who do not have the means to live freely and with rights.</p>

<p>If I was born poor and without education, I would have consented to a lot of things that I would never consent to now as an educated independent woman. What I want is to give them a chance to reach to that point. I don‚Äôt like seeing them taken advantage of. </p>

<p>Do you honestly deep down in your heart think it‚Äôs moral to pursue someone who just hasn‚Äôt had the opportunities and rights that you‚Äôve always have? Therefore, you would always have this intellectual advantage over them and have them depend on you?</p>

<p>Do you honestly think if these women were raised with full rights and decent education like women in the west, they would still pick you? Because let‚Äôs be honest here. We all know what demographic you‚Äôre going after.</p>

<p>Do you think the educated well off independent good looking women in the Philippines would choose you? </p>

<p>There‚Äôs just too much power imbalance.</p>

<p>Honestly, no, I didn‚Äôt. But they did! And it was pretty rad! Again, every woman I spent any face to face time with was educated (three of them more so than me), well traveled (all more so than me), roughly my own age (I was 36 on that trip, they were 29, 32, 35, and 40), financially independent and working good jobs, etc.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to meet anyone. I assumed that anyone I did match with would just be someone where the relationship would be extremely unequal, and I wasn‚Äôt looking for that. Instead I met many wonderful woman. It was nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you assumed a LOT about me, so forgive me if I assumed an equal amount about you.</p>

<p>Simply put, I‚Äôm not here for ‚Äúsex tourism‚Äù or even to find a partner. I‚Äôm moving here cause I have massive family network over here thanks to my amazing step-mom and her family.</p>

<p>I only even opened Tinder over here because I was curious what it would be like, having obviously heard stories from various people. I never initiated and made sure I wasn‚Äôt getting involved with any woman where there as an obvious, serious power dynamic in play. Especially because I was leaving for a couple months before coming back permanently and I didn‚Äôt think that was very fair to anyone.</p>

<p>As for actual sex, I did have sex with one of the women I met. Out of the four. I didn‚Äôt see any of them with the expectation of getting sex and was much more interested in having someone fun to explore the Islands I was on with than anything else. I also was 100% open with all of them about the fact I had plans to see other women while I was there, and that I‚Äôd be leaving for a few months before coming back. All of them were perfectly okay with that and I‚Äôve kept in touch with all of them. Hope to see them again soon, see where things go. </p>

<p>But yeah. You got me all wrong and you got what I was saying all wrong. And, honestly, you‚Äôre selling the Philippines and Filipino women in general short as well. The Philippines is a fantastic country full of fantastic people who deserve better than the disparaging world view you have of them.</p>

<p>The ‚Äúdemographic‚Äù was ‚Äúwomen between the ages of 26 and 46 (10 years my junior to 10 years my senior). All of the women I ended up spending any time with were educated, intelligent, hard working, financially independent women. I specifically took the time to make sure I wasn‚Äôt matching where there would be a massive power dynamic between us. I made sure I wasn‚Äôt matching dramatically outside my age range.</p>

<p>And again, I made first contact exactly zero times. I did nothing more than swipe left or right and then respond to the people who seemed genuinely interested in me.</p>

<p>Absolutely. Both condoms, which I bought, and a vasectomy I had 5 years ago. Would never want to do that to someone. Especially in a country like the Philippines where abortion is illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a white guy who has pretty extensive ties with the Philippines and has gotten all the &quot;you must just be a sexpat&quot; bullshit, I gotta tell you something:  It&#39;s a country, not a goddamn fucking buffet.  If you go there and get on tinder and find trash women to hook up with, you&#39;re just another fat white loser.  With the attitude you have, you&#39;re not gonna get a wife, you&#39;re gonna get some psycho foid who marries you and murders you for your inheritence.</p>

<p>Really crazy unpopular advice:  Maybe find a woman you love and then build your life around her rather than going shopping for one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the ‚Äú<em>you think lowly of Asian women</em>‚Äù is a derailment and pointing fingers. This ain‚Äôt my first rodeo.</p>

<ol>
<li> You‚Äôre the one who are going after these women because they are easy for you. </li>
<li> And you mentioned nothing about long term relationships in your previous comments. All you talked about in that thread is sex.</li>
<li> Normal people don‚Äôt hit up tinder on their family vocation. </li>
</ol>

<p>And the ‚Äú<em>you think Asian women are not capable of X</em>‚Äù argument</p>

<p>We are only capable of thinking and making decisions when we have sufficient knowledge. Women born and raised in conservative backgrounds are kept ignorant on purpose. So, when I say they are being taken advantage of, I‚Äôm not belittling them. I‚Äôm standing up for them.</p>

<p>People who have tasted sugar don‚Äôt know how sweet it is. Women who haven‚Äôt given full rights don‚Äôt know how free they could be. </p>

<p>No matter how you view it. If you view this ethically, you‚Äôre taking advantage of a developing country where young women are finding the moves and their sexuality but due to the limitation of rights and proper education, not to mention poor economy, they are often exploited by men from the west who know more, have more rights and have access to more facilities.</p>

<p>The fact that you need to travel to a developing country to get laid means you aren‚Äôt magically more attractive on the other side of the world. You‚Äôre just exploiting a loophole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And since I never treated it as a buffet, I appreciate your advice but absolutely don‚Äôt need it. Read what I wrote carefully, you‚Äôll see I responded very carefully, only talking to people I might have a real connection with. I didn‚Äôt go to the Philippines with any expectations, especially not the expectation of getting laid. I slept with one person while I was there, and that was after 4 days of getting to know them and was at their initiation. The other women I did not sleep with or attempt to sleep with because , like you said, not buffet. </p>

<p>Even my initial post in the other subreddit is in no way about sex. It‚Äôs about how, as a whiteish guy in an Asian country you will have MATCHES like a white girl in a western country. That‚Äôs it. What you do with those matches, that‚Äôs on you. </p>

<p>So yeah. I think I lot of people are just reading what they want to read here. Which is a shame, but if well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly? Nope. Doesn‚Äôt bother me one bit. Maybe it has something to do with feeling unloved and unwanted (physically or otherwise) more or less my whole life, even while in a relationship. Maybe it has something to do with my poor self esteem and my feelings of worthlessness and undesirability because of my disability. Maybe it‚Äôs just the novelty factor and it‚Äôll wear off and I‚Äôll eventually come to hate it. </p>

<p>But no. For now it feels great.</p>

<p>More than that, all of the women I‚Äôve spent time with over here are real, fully three dimensional people who treat me like a real, three dimensional person. Only one of them was overly eager to hop into bed, and when I explained I wanted to get to know her first, she respected my boundaries without complaint or question until I felt comfortable getting physical.</p>

<p>So maybe I just got lucky in that regard, but yeah, I haven‚Äôt felt like I‚Äôve experienced too much objectification and fetishization and what little I have experienced doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, if anything, the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm sorry for being so mean to you. I‚Äôm moody due to my PMS. Terrible excuse but yeah. I still stand by most of the points I made that were not personal attacks towards you. I still think it‚Äôs not ethical. </p>

<p>I understand where you are coming from. It‚Äôs a huge temptation and it‚Äôs easier for me to say as a woman who hasn‚Äôt been single for a long time. I also had quite a few very good looking men approached me in the past and they were out of my league. I rejected them solely based on the fact that they were really into me for being Asian. </p>

<p>The more I see colorism, self hate, racism, etc, I reject this idea even more because I think it‚Äôs perpetuated by people who help keep the system in motion. White people on the top and dark skinned people at the bottom.</p>

<p>Like ever since I was young, I was praised for being light skinned in my Asian community. Those ‚Äú<em>wow, you‚Äôre so pretty because your skin is so light. Every color looks good on you.</em>‚Äù I did like hearing compliments. I did like being desired. I‚Äôm sure what you‚Äôre experiencing is what I experienced back then. </p>

<p>But it‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs wrong to judge people by the color of their skin. It‚Äôs wrong for people to either like or dislike just based on my ‚ÄúAsianess.‚Äù</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the ride because it‚Äôs new for you but one day you would feel bad just like I do now. When the time comes, I hope you do the right thing. I also hope you value yourself as an individual and find someone who loves you for who you are because it‚Äôs very different from being loved for your race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I‚Äôm sorry for being so reactionary and mean to you. I think it‚Äôs a natural reaction on the internet to assume the worst of people and my original post was very flippant and I can easily see how you could read ill-intent into it.</p>

<p>So no hard feelings on my end.</p>

<p>And I hear you on a lot of the points you made. I didn‚Äôt give one thought to the human trafficking side of things, and you‚Äôve made me a lot more conscious of that. I lived in a country where it‚Äôs not as big of an issue as it is in Asia, so it‚Äôs just not something you think much about, you know? So I appreciate that. Always good to have someone with more life experience in an important area like that to help you understand things better. </p>

<p>As for my future, I‚Äôm doing my best to stay grounded. I do want someone who will love me for the long term. I just turned 37, I‚Äôm not getting any younger, and I‚Äôm not going to become a millionaire tomorrow, so finding someone who cares about me for me and not for superficial characteristics is super important to me.</p>

<p>But it is nice to be able to get that foot in the door, if you know what I mean. I know I have a lot of short comings, I‚Äôm working hard on the ones I can change (like my weight), but it was really demoralizing to be more or less invisible in the USA. At least here people give me a chance. And that not only means I might find that special someone, but it means I get to feel like a real flesh and blood person, which, not going to lie, is REALLY nice.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not here in the Philippines for sex. I‚Äôm not even here for a relationship. I‚Äôm here to start a new life in a beautiful country filled with some of the most genuinely friendly people I‚Äôve ever met. That‚Äôs what made me want to move here. If I can find someone to spend the rest of my life with, that‚Äôd be amazing. But step 1 is living he best life I can live here in my new home. And part of that is being culturally and socially aware of the differences between here and the home I used to know. It‚Äôs an ongoing, daily process, but it‚Äôs one that will make me a happier, better person, so it‚Äôs worth it.</p>
