    <div class="md"><p>So I’ve noticed there is a lot of people who are extremely insecure about their height, and I think it’s insane!</p>

<p>I believe short men are much more attractive than tall men. I believe around 5’ and 5’5 is the perfect height for men.</p>

<p>For instance, the shorter you are, the easier you are to pick up and have anal sex. Guys who are tall usually weigh a lot more, and are harder to adjust it properly. In my experience men who are short also tend to be cuter than taller men, though that’s not a fact, it just happens more often that I see a cute small guy.</p>

<p>The weight is a major benefit, the fact that you can be 110 lbs without being super skinny is awesome. I can appreciate a man who is in shape but isn’t going to break my back trying to lift.</p>

<p>In conclusion, be happy about your height</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Horse pussy is honestly a gift from god. Yesterday I was tending to my mares and just noticed that Beffica (my strongest white purebred) had the wettest equine pussy I had ever laid my peepers on. I immediately dove in headfirst and started eating her out. She whinnied in pleasure as I devoured her horsey snatch. Soon I could feel her about to horse cum so I reverse-vored myself inside her and tickled her ovaries until she unleashed a torrent of horse squirt on my eager face. I was far from done though, and so I decided to whip out my genetically engineered horse cock and give her a round two. Beffica looked at me with a horse lust in her eyes and I pounded the absolute shit out of her. Before long, all four of her horse legs were on their horse knees and his cock was 26 inches deep inside her. I felt a tightening in my whole body before surreptitiously unloading an absolutely monstrous explosion of ejaculate that emptied my sack and completely filled Beffica to burst. My seed started to leak out around my balls and Beffica collapsed in a cummy heap. My phallus retracted back into my lower intestine and I collapsed in exhaustion. All of a sudden, I was flipped on my stomach and my pants were ripped from me. It was Beffica! I craned my head to the left and noticed something I hadn’t seen before. A monstrous horse donger was cradled in between her legs. I shuddered, never having gotten to 7th base (pegging) before. I had barely a second to prepare myself before what felt like at least 30 inches of rock hard femcock entered my tight virgin asshole, ripping me nearly in two. It honestly felt like I was being ripped in half, and of course after 3 or so hours she came. And when I say she came, I mean she came! I had filled her dripping wet Hussy with cum, no doubt almost a litre. She, on the other hand, unleashed what had to be at least a milk jug’s worth of cum into my raw and bleeding asshole. I honestly didn&#39;t expect it to be as hot as it was, which definitely made up for being raped by a horse. I crawled to my knees, horse batter dripping from my pooter and shivered slightly. I still needed to tend to the other horses and it was already 7pm. Sigh. I pulled my ripped cowboy jeans back on and placed my leather cap on my head, and made my way to the door, I gave a wink to sweet Beffica, and she simply neighed and shot another glob of cum in my direction. I caught it, and used it to smoothen my hair. Did you know that horse cum is great for the skin, scalp, dandruff and as a hair gel? I learned that yesterday too.</p>
