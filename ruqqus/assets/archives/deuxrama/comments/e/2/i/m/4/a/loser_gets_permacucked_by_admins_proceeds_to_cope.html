<p>So really you’re just describing yourself again. Color me shocked.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Considering you’re on your 29th or is 31st alt account and on your most recent ban you were pretending to be a woman who was a pedophile. What do you usually get banned for? Oh right, harassing people, posting child porn(specifically sending it to people who posted on <a href="/r/Tor">/r/Tor</a>) though you haven’t done that in a while so maybe you grew a brain, threats of sexual assault and overall being a pathetic nuisance.  </p>

<p>Coming from the guy was was pretending to be a 20-22 year old “Loli” on <a href="/r/rapekink">/r/rapekink</a>. What was that account’s name again? Oh right <a href="/u/LoliGirl22LL">/u/LoliGirl22LL</a> aka <a href="/u/LGLL22">/u/LGLL22</a>. Also need I remind you that I’ve only been suspended once, you’ve been suspended over 30 times now, I also don’t have to pretend to be other people that’s your job yet again and so far I’ve been fairly open about who I am here on Reddit. You can’t even decide what country you’re from, what race you are, what college you attend and what language you speak. Still pretending to be German it did you switch back to saying you’re Romanian?</p>

<p>Still as delusional as ever eh? Separate accounts for different people yet you insist on saying they’re the same exact person. What a strange creature you are indeed, delusional yet you accuse everyone of being delusional like most hypocrites. Do you really think this is over? Wrong. Instead you have merely freed me up to continue to compile evidence against you in a more productive manner. No longer held back by Reddit’s policy of protecting child molesters, rapists and pedophiles, I can spread the info much farther now and to much more “excitable” audiences. People who are nothing like me at all, in that they have very few if any limitations when it comes to pedophiles like you bragging about wanting to commit crimes. And besides, you’ve been banned so many times as it is I doubt your account will be around much longer. As for me, we’ll let’s just say I won’t have much use for this account anymore. I’ll be back eventually, permanently. You won’t even know it’s me, you’ll never know it’s me and I definitely won’t get suspended ever again. Your accounts will continue to suffer ban after ban after ban, like they always do. My infopasta will continue to be posted under each post you make. You were better off when I wasn’t suspended because now you’re just fucked.</p>

<p>Also funny to see you couldn’t score the two Asian girls you wanted as victims that were your type, yet the one with boobs seems to be talking to you. Also if any of this was true you would have posted about it publicly. Yet you didn’t. Your lies never cease to amaze me YameteOniiChanItai.</p>

<p>Also just for the record, I have good chances with the other Asian girl too. Very good ones</p>

<p>If she was into you romantically she probably would’ve told you by now. You’re starting to sound like Russell Greer, if you want to know who this is I suggest you look up “Russell Greer Taylor Swift Stalker.” </p>

<p>A red box with Chinese writing that means beloved friend and you automatically assume romance. You’re really not that bright and it continues to show.

<p>Yet she has a boyfriend. If she didn’t you wouldn’t keep saying he was.</p>

<p>Have never once called myself a MGTOW. Mainly because I don’t hate the opposite gender and I also don’t cry about not being able to rape preteen girls. Although you do have that in common with the MGTOW movement. </p>

<p>Still think you did something insanitary to those cookies, considering you don’t have a single ounce of human decency, no social aware that and generally act like a buffoon.</p>

<p>Same with the other girl, but she actually broke up with her boyfriend. But only very recently, I thought they were split up for longer. But it&#39;s only been a few weeks.

<p>Delusion with a hint of projection as you specifically said she isn’t your type and is just a consolation prize. Hence why I’m not particularly worried about her safety, it’s the one without tits I’m worried about. </p>

<p>And there we have the projection though you should be asking why the one you wanted isn’t interested. 30+ accounts and you still can’t accurately point out aspects of my personality despite being quite blunt with who and what I am.

<p>Oh look at that, the pedophile with the hebephile tendencies and open biastophile grew a conscience all of a sudden. Unless you’re worried someone will hurt her first, I’m better the latter considering you DID say you wanted to drug underage girls. </p>

<p>Yeah and I totally didn’t get suspended from Reddit I made that shit up /s</p>

<p>Maybe she is. Her ex sounds like a nerd loser so she&#39;s probably trying to get with a Chaddy, strong guy like me to get back at him. Still my feelings aren&#39;t some girls playball. But that does make me feel less bad for prioritizing the small girl in any case.</p>

<p>Gonna give you some advice. I mean besides playing in traffic, hanging yourself, screaming “Allah Akbar!” in a crowded mall near some cops, drinking cyanide or drinking drain cleaner or seeing if you can fly after jumping from a building: Show this girl your Reddit account, tell her you’re just an eccentric guy, tell her I’m just some evil asshole on Reddit and tell her that you actually care about her and want to be honest with her. If she actually cares about you she will accept you. If you’re actually a good person you’ll be honest with her. For once I’m not being sarcastic or an asshole. I’m as serious as my permanent suspension right now. If she cares about you, she will accept you and if you’re a nice person as you claim to be you will be honest with her. Honesty is key in relationships and the earlier the better.</p>

<p>So one weighted chin-up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t do 1 RMs. Pull-ups, chin-ups and dips I have programmed in a 5-7 rep range. Once I get to 7 I&#39;d up the weight. You obviously don&#39;t understand strength science or strength training. The amount of repetitions you perform only matters in regards to the weight you&#39;re lifting. Say you&#39;re doing chin-ups, doing 15 bodyweight ones in one set is less impressive than say doing 6 with 60 lbs (depending on your bodyweight). </p>

<p>This number actually corresponds somewhat to your absolute strength, which is what 1 RMs are about. You can google that. You could a 1 RM with chin-ups too of course. Say you&#39;re 180 lbs. Being able to do 1 chin-up with 110 lbs added likely means you are stronger than someone who can do 16 or so but only with bodyweight in one set.</p>

<p>I mean you clearly don&#39;t understand this so I&#39;m trying to educate you.</p>

<p>Also why would she ask me for my number and want us to hang out regularly if she wasn&#39;t into me. She just broke up with the guy, probably was drawn to me cause of my muscular looks. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>it&#39;s not like we&#39;d get married</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a relief. Hopefully she’ll find a good partner someday, preferably one who won’t hate any sons that she births and won’t end up molesting her daughters. But you have no romantic interests in her so once again; she’s safe. Unless she marries someone like you in which case she’s not gonna fair well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t do 1 RMs. Pull-ups, chin-ups and dips I have programmed in a 5-7 rep range. Once I get to 7 I&#39;d up the weight. You obviously don&#39;t understand strength science or strength training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually do understand, I just know that triggering you brings about this sort of dialogue. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The amount of repetitions you perform only matters in regards to the weight you&#39;re lifting. Say you&#39;re doing chin-ups, doing 15 bodyweight ones in one set is less impressive than say doing 6 with 60 lbs (depending on your bodyweight).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am aware of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This number actually corresponds somewhat to your absolute strength, which is what 1 RMs are about. You can google that. You could a 1 RM with chin-ups too of course. Say you&#39;re 180 lbs. Being able to do 1 chin-up with 110 lbs added likely means you are stronger than someone who can do 16 or so but only with bodyweight in one set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So long story short you can’t do one chin-up. Because that’s what workers this initially. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean you clearly don&#39;t understand this so I&#39;m trying to educate you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do understand but sometimes letting you rant makes you less of a whiny bitch. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also why would she ask me for my number and want us to hang out regularly if she wasn&#39;t into me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering I’m still friends with and hang out with some of my lady friends from college. One of whom is gay. She asked for my number in college and I already knew she gay considering she was rather open about this on campus. Just without being annoying about it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She just broke up with the guy, probably was drawn to me cause of my muscular looks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The amount of which you get triggered when someone says you aren’t muscular, guarantees you aren’t muscular. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well I didn&#39;t call her that to her face, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I seriously doubt that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>that&#39;s just mean. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude you’ve done worse shit than that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean the smaller one has priority still, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And a boyfriend </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve also known her longer and she&#39;s cuter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And apparently not single and you’re not boyfriend material or any sort of healthy relationship material considering you wanted to know what sort of Incel-esq hatemail you should send her because she didn’t message back immediately. </p>

<p>Serious question: are you actually Onision? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some Asian women are small, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Duh I’ve dated some. Fine line between small and literally saying you want a partner who outright looks like a child and only because they look like a child. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>deal with it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming from the guy who regularly throws tantrums. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t be mean to this girl, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not. You’re the one who said you wanted to fuck a 10 year old. Not to mention that folder you admitted to keeping and the illegal stuff you would post and DM people. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>she&#39;s adorable and everyone likes her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m sure she’s lovely. A pity she has you following her around like stink on shit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a JAV of a girl with not big boobs giving a tit job though. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, it’s like trying to fuck a table. No offense to women who are small or completely flat but that just doesn’t do it for me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>IBW-627z at around 1:26. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really into JAV except for like six random ones you already know why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cute actress too</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do I get the feeling she’s going to look like she’s at least 10 years old. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nah I wouldn&#39;t do that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I call bullshit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That would make her less suitable as a potential plan B.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She’s already your Plan B.</p>

<p>hmm, if he is she treats him quite badly. </p>

<p>Let me guess, she doesn’t call him senpai or whatever the fuck it is you’re into besides children?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ll investigate on that when I see him next time in our language class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you finally talk to him? Progress. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they really do, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In her case this is very much true. After all you have zero sexual interest in her. So no chances of her being roofied or raped by you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>she&#39;s also like 6&#39; but I&#39;m sure she&#39;s a nice woman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So she’s hot, has a great rack, great ass and is TALLER than you? Yep you’re definitely settling 😂😂😂😂 hope she finds herself a real man eventually. Seems like a great woman. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>10? idk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those pictures of little girls you were sending to the people at <a href="/r/Tor">/r/Tor</a> appeared to be 10 according to the people who clicked the links. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing&#39;s ever been tampered with, it&#39;s all good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doubt it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s an endearing term. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof you’ve never been in a relationship before, even a casual one.”Hey I’m only with you because my preferred victim type hasn’t been alone long enough for me to try something. So I’m just with you until I can get some roofies.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think she&#39;s nice too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah you don’t really seem to think that. However you’ve exposed yourself as being a narcissist parasite. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However the smaller one is also more ambitious </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So way out of your league then. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(yet less gifted than me) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only because she didn’t text you back immediately. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>which makes us a better fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. Ambitious people tend to do better with other ambitious people or at least with people who are intelligent and supportive. So that rules you out. You’re only ambition involves things that’ll grant you a lengthy prison sentence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would you pity them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One is being strung along by you and the other one is being stalked by you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still like her personality tho</p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they can&#39;t all be flatchested nymphets :(</p>

<p>Your loss is a real man’s gain. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably not. I mean if he is she&#39;s treating him really badly which would be a warning to me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah she doesn’t call senpai and doesn’t dress up like a sexualized 5 year old for him right? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I might subtly ask him about their status</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve been saying that for months. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just temporarily. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully she finds a real man who actually accepts her and likes her instead of treating her like garbage. Oh but wait you say you’re a “nice guy.” </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then for summer I get super shredded </p>

<p>Cheese yeah I know. </p>

<p>and find a qt tiny one</p>

<p>Still haven’t managed to find one that’ll agree to be alone with you. Smart women. Just don’t on a shooting spree or become a serial rapist. Assuming you already aren’t the latter considering you did post pictures of children being abused.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a different girl. That&#39;s the one the small one is friends with. The other one I&#39;m friends with doesn&#39;t know the smaller one.

<p>No, I just think her approach isn&#39;t that good. She&#39;s the sort of person who equates time spent and effort with results, while I proceed more systemically. Still she&#39;s such a trooper, I often see how long she spents learning because she leaves her backpack outside.</p>

<p>So she can definitely go better than you, hence why you’re settling for two women that are not your type. What’s pathetic is you using the excuse “but I like their personality” which is false.

<p>Knowing how stupid you are you’re going to cite a percentage that’s wildly unhealthy and upon correction you’ll claim I’m wrong. Since my leg healed up I’ve added more workouts to my daily routine and nightly routine, lost the 10 pounds of unwanted weight that I gained during down time, I can deadlift again without trouble(well above my body weight), better reps, improved form, got a better job offer last week that I’ll be taking and best of all I didn’t have to settle for my fiancée.

<p>I said if they are dating she treats him badly though. Like she doesn&#39;t even call him her boyfriend or acknowledge his existence even, she just said to me he was someone she knew.

<p>I wanted to get quite lean so under 10%, 8 to 10 is really, really lean, it&#39;s still sustainable with good diet but given that I haven&#39;t really maxxed out my gains at all yet I&#39;d try to get really lean until April / May and then do a lean bulk to a bit higher like 14 or so over many months.</p>

<p>Considering I don’t even believe you, if she actually is this shitty of a person you’re essentially a Megacuck for wanting her.

<p>Yeah people tend to take their partners places. My fiancée would take me places and run errands for me when my leg was broken.

<p>Serious question: what gains? And don’t play that “But muh doxxing!” bullshit. It’s called taking a picture in front of a nondescript white wall, not wearing your university sweatshirt or just not having anything identifiable in your picture. Problem solved. </p>

<p>there&#39;s a difference between that and just using someone for their ressources and time. That&#39;s how you end up like Sam Rothstein in Casino. Their relationship was just based on him providing her with money and gifts.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t see the point of that. Why would I want to proof anything to some fat dude on reddit? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I weight 256 pounds, 12% body fat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe the 256 pounds part, fucking lol. At 12% BF, suuuuuuuureeee. This also comes from the guy who didn&#39;t understand that reps refers to the number of repetitions in one set and who did a 100 pull up / push up per day challenge. So basically a complete dyel who never set foot in a gym. </p>

<p>Just to elaborate on how ridiculous your claims are (why don&#39;t you google some believable numbers?). To have a reasonable FFMI at those stats you&#39;d have to be 7&#39;. Also note that people who are 7&#39; are not only quite rare but usually lack the bone structure to acquire that much muscle.</p>

<p>This would also mean you have roughly the same muscle mass as Arnold Schwarzenegger. </p>

<p>When can we expect your Mr. Olympia debut, oh genetically gifted one?</p>

<p>I mean additionally to that since you just had to quit your moonlighting bodybuilding activities for your lower half since you were injured it&#39;s fair to assume that at your tremendous size you lost over 20 lbs in lower body mass due to muscle atrophy. Which means you&#39;re actually around 280 lbs and 12% bodyfat when you&#39;re actively and regularly training. </p>

<p>That&#39;s very impressive, you&#39;re a big guy. Of course haters would say those are lies but I totally believe you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dangerous and have the potential to kill you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, exactly. They are cunning, devious, evil at times even. Sometimes they are nice but it&#39;s calculated, some could be genuinely nice but who knows. And they do definitely consider disposing of you in marriage but I can live with the risk. </p>

<p>In any case their delicious small, loli bodies make more than good for it.</p>

<p>You said more than once. </p>

<p>there&#39;s a difference between that and just using someone for their ressources and time. </p>

<p>For once you’re actually right about something. But let’s face it that’s something you’d probably accept. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s how you end up like Sam Rothstein in Casino. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you actually know that movie exists. That’s a surprise. Though let’s be honest that’s definitely you in the future if you actually manage to get into a relationship. If an Asian girl told you to drink her piss you’d do it if I meant she’d <strong>date</strong> you. You’d probably do something beyond demeaning to get her to marry you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their relationship was just based on him providing her with money and gifts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take notes, that’s gonna be you one day but without the happy-ish ending and being a somewhat good father(fyi Sam didn’t screw his daughter, try to follow that example). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s hot, I love those girls</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you’re incredibly gullible so if one of them wanted to take advantage of you it would be easy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t be so sure. We already have a date for Chinese New Year at least</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You suddenly like Asian women with tits. Yeah right. She’s your little consolation prize until you dump her for a flat chested one(so that’s gonna take a long time). But still I find it funny that you’re just settling, although it is quite shitty if you do stay with her and lead her on. Not surprising though as you are a shitty person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. If she does I can still ask her out and she can decline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, if she was actually single we’d never hear the end of it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I explained that I only know about it because we are neighbors, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You actually never said any of that though. Lying again?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so she and me had the same route that day, and she didn&#39;t call him her boyfriend either</p>

<p>I’m sure he’ll manage unless you’re gonna slide into his DMs</p>

<p>Judging on his tastes he likes women that have a noticeable female physique and are into fitness. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I honestly don&#39;t see the point of that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re really clueless when it comes to people being serious and just being sarcastic or rude and it shows. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would I want to proof anything to some fat dude on reddit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to “proof” something to yourself? Don’t you mean prove?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe the 256 pounds part, fucking lol. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is going to be followed by salt, cattiness, a dash of you being a bitter cunt and served up with a heaping side of dumb shit and for dessert more proof of you being a retard right? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 12% BF, suuuuuuuureeee. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meh I don’t particularly care if you believe me or not but watching you get triggered over it is kinda funny. Maybe I should talk about myself more often if this is the end result. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This also comes from the guy who didn&#39;t understand that reps refers to the number of repetitions in one set and who did a 100 pull up / push up per day challenge. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coming from the guy who can’t tell when people are clearly fucking with him unless the specifically say they are, most of those challenges are memes anyway and hardly useful for sustaining ones gains or even leading to weight loss. I mean me calling you retard is mostly just me being an asshole but I see there is truth to those words. You actually thought I was fucking serious, no one else fell for that but you. Only you(well you and a few uninformed people) fell for it, Jesus H Christ do I have to put an /s next to everything that is sarcasm? <sup>dumbass<sup>would-be<sup>childfucker<sup>probably<sup>thinks<sup>I<sup>was<sup>serious<sup>when<sup>I<sup>said<sup>I<sup>was<sup>Rasputin<sup>too.^</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>So basically a complete dyel who never set foot in a gym.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actually do lift you brain dead poof, need to be able to lift with my line of work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just to elaborate on how ridiculous your claims are (why don&#39;t you google some believable numbers?). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re confusing 12% with 6% which would mean I should resemble Brandon Curry when I don’t. My percentage is actually considered sustainable if I go up some(anything but 25% it’s a personal preference) my muscles will still be defined. This is about as far as I intend to go as I have no plans to compete if any sort of bodybuilding competitions. I’m buff yet don’t exactly have the “bodybuilder” most would expect when they actually see pictures of today’s bodybuilders so of course you’re going to claim I’m lying. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To have a reasonable FFMI at those stats you&#39;d have to be 7&#39;. Also note that people who are 7&#39; are not only quite rare but usually lack the bone structure to acquire that much muscle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve always been a big guy so to speak I’m just not fat any more. Picture Randy Orton in his prime(yeah yeah he’s wrestler I know) but an inch taller, 12% bodyfat instead of 15% and 6 extra pounds. And as side note with darker hair, more of a beard and more tattoos. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This would also mean you have roughly the same muscle mass as Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his prime? Not even close and I never wanted a Mr Universe physique as it’s not sustainable and most of those men are on roids or only have that specific look when they are competing. Plus I’m 6’6, Arnold is 6’2. He really shouldn’t have gone vegan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When can we expect your Mr. Olympia debut, oh genetically gifted one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good good, let the butthurt through you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean additionally to that since you just had to quit your moonlighting bodybuilding activities for your lower half since you were injured it&#39;s fair to assume that at your tremendous size you lost over 20 lbs in lower body mass due to muscle atrophy. Which means you&#39;re actually around 280 lbs and 12% bodyfat when you&#39;re actively and regularly training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually I gained weight, I’m an active guy(no this is about cardio I already know you’re gonna claim that) and I ended up gaining weight during my down time. I could still move around(and did try to do SOME upper body exercises) but wasn’t at the gym or working out at home obviously due to my cast. That being said moving around when your injury consisted of your tibia popping out to say “Hello!” after having heavy equipment falling on it ain’t easy. Would’ve been up sooner if I had Brock Lesnar’s freakishly fast healing rate. Didn’t suffer too much muscle atrophy and if I was 280 pounds I would’ve definitely noticed that. We actually had this argument months ago where you claimed I was lying about my weight and I proved you wrong. I’m just half assing my way through this right now because it’s late and I’ve got a 6 hour drive to make tomorrow. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s very impressive, you&#39;re a big guy. Of course haters would say those are lies but I totally believe you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’re not good at sarcasm. Like, at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, exactly. They are cunning, devious, evil at times even. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hope you have a good job. Gonna need it for all those alimony payments you’ll be making. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes they are nice but it&#39;s calculated, some could be genuinely nice but who knows. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep, I see alimony in your future. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they do definitely consider disposing of you in marriage but I can live with the risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like I said: Megacuck.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In any case their delicious small, loli bodies make more than good for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In your mind this is truly limited to the ones who are 10 years old.</p>

<p>Seems gay to me. Personally I like women who are small, skinny, and cute. She&#39;d sit at home drinking Chinese green tea from a delicate porcelain cup, reading in a paperback version of selected poems by Verlaine while listening to Rubinstein playing Chopin nocturnes. Of course she&#39;d play piano herself but her soft, small hands, barely abely to reach an octave would be much better suited for baroque works so during my insomniac nights we&#39;d often stay up together while she&#39;d play me her gentle yet inspired interpretation of Bach&#39;s Goldberg Variations as did the count in times long past. We&#39;d raise two kids together, two girls, both gentle, smart, kind but with a witty sense of humour.</p>

<p>Her interest would lie in the arts, mainly music and literature, rather than in working out. Still it would be something she appreciates about me. As such her shining intellect would stand in stark contrast to her cute, childlike appearance.</p>

<p>Well this doesn&#39;t really apply to the small girl since she&#39;s more into pop music. I found a 19 year old who plays piano and likes classical music but she&#39;s only here for a few months unfortunately. She was cute too, not quite as short but slim, pretty, with short hair and a delicate figure.</p>

<p>Also your extensive rambling about how you&#39;re totally 260 lbs at 12% BF (lol) is dumb. If you are 260 lbs you&#39;re not 12% BF, you just fat. As I said for 260 lbs to be a reasonable FFMI you&#39;d need to be 7&#39;, and you&#39;re not 7&#39;.</p>

The pedophile pest has come back under the name <a href="/u/First_Individual">/u/First_Individual</a>(also suspended). This man is a sick fuck. He also was banned for describing wanting to rape a 10 year old girl as part of a “big brother/little sister” rape fantasy of his on <a href="/r/justneckbeardthings">/r/justneckbeardthings</a>. Recently he has taken to harassing people on Reddit who call him out as well as doubling down on why his pedophilia and mild hebephilia should be viewed as a legitimate orientation and anyone who doesn’t agree with him is automatically a bigot or a troll or an alt. Also <a href="/u/LGLL26">/u/LGLL26</a>(suspended) and <a href="/u/CoupeMaster">/u/CoupeMaster</a>(also suspended) might be one of his alts as well and <a href="/u/PRs4MyWaifu">/u/PRs4MyWaifu</a> is a fake alt he gave. He’s expressed interest in having “cute half Asian daughters but no boys because they have mental problems” which might be a front for saying he wants daughters so he can live out his fantasy of raping “real life lolis” as he doesn’t have much interest in boys though he did say he likes “twink” underage boys and finds their bodies very attractive. This person has also admitted to keeping a photo album full of pictures of children that he masturbates too and has mentioned using sunglasses to hide the fact that he enjoys leering at little girls. He’s also expressed his interest in traveling to Asian countries where trafficking underage children is very common. If you actually know this man and you have children it is ill advised to continue associating with him. Another development is that he’s recently expressed his interest in adopting a little girl to “raise and adore” as he put it, I don’t think I have to tell you what he really intends. There’s also a good chance he may have fled his home country of Hungary and gone to Switzerland or Sweden to escape a rape charge involving an underage girl, not a “legal but underage” girl but one who was too young. Take the last few parts with a grain of salt as this guy routinely lies about where he is from and has lied about his ethnicity as well. He also routinely lies about his health and weight as well, he is either obese or “scrawny.” This isn’t me going after someone for thought crimes, he fully intends to offend one day if he hasn’t already by this point. I’d also like to add that if you happen to know an Asian woman(possibly East Asian, Chinese, Korean or Japanese) attending school in Hungary or Sweden or Switzerland, between the ages of 18 and 26, standing at 4’10 to 5’3 please reach out to her immediately. This man has expressed his “interests” in capturing the quote “real life loli and doing so many fun things with her little loli body.” This man is dangerous so please if you know anyone in the countries mentioned who fits this description please tell her to be on her guard at all times. Also if you’re an Asian woman keep in mind he’s directly said that your entire race’s purpose is to “serve as perfect substitutes for pedophiles and hebephiles.” Another recent development regarding this subhuman cyst: he has started fabricating stories about himself being the victim of sexual assault at the age of 10 at the hands of an alleged aunt. This is a bogus claim as the “scenario” he described is the same scenario he previously described as wanting to act out with a 10-year old girl, namely this girl crying while he told her “Let uncle enjoy your cute loli body.” So he’s an even bigger piece of shit now that he’s added false rape/abuse/molestation claims to his scum resume. </p>

<p>Also here’s a helpful link for anyone seeing this </p>

<p>There’s also a little link here to a story he wanted to write </p>

<p>Along with the post he made about wanting to adopt a little girl(will edit if he deletes but I have the screenshot) </p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/fizba4wc31b31.png">https://i.redd.it/fizba4wc31b31.png</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, it appears this future Chinese wife is actually fictional to some degree considering she’s actually a Japanese fuck-pillow </p>

<p>Update: On his account </p>

<p><a href="/u/TheSadlstKingOfTypos">/u/TheSadlstKingOfTypos</a>(the parody of my account) he let it slip that he likes slim women due to a medical disorder he has, it’s commonly referred to as “micro penis.” What does this have to do with his love of small women and young girls aged 10 to 14 along with his fetish for incestous rape? Well he feels that despite his penis size being closer to that an adult woman’s small clitoris he would be able to a achieve penetration with a small adult woman or a small child. </p>

<p>Yet another update: he’s now saying he is in Romania and goes on to further confirm that his sole reason for being attracted to his “totally real future Chinese murder/rape victim-I mean wife” is because she looks like she’s 12-years old. If you’re trying to convince people you’re not a pedophile/hebephile, maybe don’t act like one.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/qbesHR9">https://m.imgur.com/a/qbesHR9</a></p>

<p>He’s now claiming to be bisexual </p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/lt0uct8v5ng31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/lt0uct8v5ng31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Update: May actually be a resident of South Bend, Indiana as he claimed to be a Notre Dame student. I should also add that this person has been known to post or PM .onion links to people so careful clicking on any links he sends. Although not clicking them all together is a smarter choice. I’d also like to point out that if you’re an Asian woman or Asian man you might want to refrain for mentioning it to this man, if you’re a woman he he will harass you and constantly ask you if you have a “sexy little loli body” and may even ask for nudes. If you’re a man he’ll still harass you and claim that you aren’t a real man because you are Asian. Also if any of you post on Cringetopia, justneckbeardthings, justlegbeardthings, PedoLogic, unpopularopinion, BotchedSurgeries or any NSFW sub’s dedicated to asses or boobs or Hitomi Tanaka he’ll automatically assume that you are me because I post in those subs.</p>

<p>Update: He seems to slipping up regarding the height of the Chinese girl he supposedly friends with. First he says she’s 4’11 then he says she’s 4’10. </p>

<p>Another update:</p>

<p>He’s getting dumber slipped up several times in this screenshot from another person he seems to have a crush on.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/vJNkB4f">https://m.imgur.com/a/vJNkB4f</a></p>

<p>Yet another goddamn update: He now claims his fictional crush is 4’9. Politicians call tell better lies than this guy! </p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/57nrtksshxo31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/57nrtksshxo31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen a picture of his girlfriend/the 4’9(or 4’10 or 4’11) Chinese loli he talks about. It’s official? There is no Chinese girl he’s talking to so we have nothin to worry about, except him possibly finding a real life woman or little girl and assaulting them or killing them.</p>

<p>Please note this is sarcasm.</p>

<p>Clears Throat In Farnsworth: Good news everyone! It seems the malignant tumor was rejected by his target/future victim, he’s now going on racist rants about her. The bad news is he’s still alive.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/z5djnssdz4q31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/z5djnssdz4q31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Great Update: He admitted to being YameteOniiChanItai </p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/oq74kndrtkq31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/oq74kndrtkq31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Because Part 1 ran out of room 😑. His new alt is and recently revived his account <a href="/u/NeverDiddledKids">/u/NeverDiddledKids</a>(suspended).Now as per his account <a href="/u/NeverDiddledKids">/u/NeverDiddledKids</a> his Asian target has a boyfriend, though he keeps pretending she doesn’t have one yet routinely calls the guy her boyfriend. Since his suspension he has come back as <a href="/u/MayoDickForAznChicks">/u/MayoDickForAznChicks</a> which got suspended in damn near record time. He recently came back as <a href="/u/FluffyVegetable">/u/FluffyVegetable</a> which also got suspended in record time. He has since came back as <a href="/u/Slight-Listen">/u/Slight-Listen</a> which will probably get suspended yet again(didn’t last two days it’s gone). Why he insists on telling me his life story is beyond me. On the upside he wasn’t responsible for the recent mass shooting in California. I should note that our <em>favorite</em> pedophile with hebephile tendencies is back again as <a href="/u/SwiftRec0very">/u/SwiftRec0very</a> which won’t last either as I suspect he has a sitewide ban as well. </p>

<p>Another Redditor uploaded this post he(saved in case of deletion), seems he’s not muscular at all</p>

<p>Update: he now thinks his target is a pedo but it’s just him projecting his mental illness onto the girl he wants to rape and his body type on her boyfriend </p>

<p>I’d also like to add some clarifications regarding his history of child porn posting. He wasn’t specifically random in who he sent the links to. He wanted people who he DM’d to see what was in the links. The users he DM’d were/are part of the <a href="/r/Tor">/r/Tor</a> sub-Reddit and/or <a href="/r/onions">/r/onions</a>, some of the people he targeted still post there, some don’t and some deleted their accounts. He seems to think I’m stupid and just making shit up.</p>

<p>He also likes to claim he didn’t message people when he does in fact message them </p>

<p>Update: He might’ve joined Incels.co </p>

<p>Update: Well folks I’ve been permanently nuked, but no worries I’ll be back permanently one day because I’m just as persistent as Early Cuyler whoo baby! Also I would like to take a moment to add that the other alt account for YameteOniiChanItai known as <a href="/u/LoliGirlLL22">/u/LoliGirlLL22</a> was permanently suspended as well. Can’t imagine why, seemed like such a wholesome and family friendly account what with her posts being featured on the now banned <a href="/r/AgeplayPenpals">/r/AgeplayPenpals</a> where she wanted to roleplay as a 10-year old girl in an abusive sexual relationship with her older brother and another where she wanted to have a similar roleplay setting with someone pretending to be her father and she a girl of half Asian ancestry. Funny, that’s something that YameteOniiChanItai was(and still is) heavily into what with him saying he wanted to rape any daughters he has, kill his male children and also made it clear he seems to admire and possibly even idolize Josef Fritzl. I should also note that he has recently began to harass another woman on Reddit as he believes any account that commented in the same subs I frequented was an alt account of my and my associate <a href="/u/AlphaOmegaSithReborn">/u/AlphaOmegaSithReborn</a>. I would like to take this time to also announce that Sith will not be returning to Reddit as he has explained he’s tired of Reddit shielding and protecting pedophiles who openly commit crimes on this website(such as YameteOniiChanItai and his previous history of posting and sending child porn to people, including AlphaOmegaSith under his first account). My other associate has expressed their desire to return to Reddit as well, though they will be keeping a much lower profile but will still be aiding me in ensuring that YameteOniiChanItai and people like him can never cause harm to anyone. In closing, during my rather unfortunate hiatus I would like to pass on this infopasta as well as my original infopasta for anyone who would like to use it to help prevent pedophiles from victimizing others. </p>

<p>Blunder: n regards to the account of the name <a href="/u/LittleKnifeMachiko">/u/LittleKnifeMachiko</a>, I am not personally affiliated with the person behind that account and it seems they weren’t involved in any of my actions here. As to why this person was suspended I am not sure. YameteOniiChanItai has accused me of being the owner of all the accounts yet this has been proven to be false. He has also accused me of lying about my personal life, when in reality he lies all the time about his antics both here and on Reddit.</p>

<p>Possible Final Update: Almost forgot, YameteOniiChanItai might have another alternative account under the name <a href="/u/dingleberryb0b">/u/dingleberryb0b</a> where he likes to spread his pro-pedophile/hebephile propaganda of how being against child sexual abuse is somehow sexist. Please be very careful when dealing with this individual. As for the woman that YameteOniiChanItai was targeting and expressed his desire to drug and assault, nothing has happened to her thankfully and it seems YameteOniiChanItai is focusing on a woman who doesn’t fit his standards for a potential victim so I am not particularly scared for her safety. He was going to target another young Asian girl but she will be out of his reach permanently soon. I wish you all safety and and happiness and may we some day meet again. </p>

<p>hmm, if he is she treats him quite badly. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me guess, she doesn’t call him senpai or whatever the fuck it is you’re into besides children?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe I&#39;ll investigate on that when I see him next time in our language class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh you finally talk to him? Progress. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they really do, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In her case this is very much true. After all you have zero sexual interest in her. So no chances of her being roofied or raped by you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>she&#39;s also like 6&#39; but I&#39;m sure she&#39;s a nice woman</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So she’s hot, has a great rack, great ass and is TALLER than you? Yep you’re definitely settling 😂😂😂😂 hope she finds herself a real man eventually. Seems like a great woman. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>10? idk</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those pictures of little girls you were sending to the people at <a href="/r/Tor">/r/Tor</a> appeared to be 10 according to the people who clicked the links. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing&#39;s ever been tampered with, it&#39;s all good</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doubt it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s an endearing term. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof you’ve never been in a relationship before, even a casual one.”Hey I’m only with you because my preferred victim type hasn’t been alone long enough for me to try something. So I’m just with you until I can get some roofies.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think she&#39;s nice too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah you don’t really seem to think that. However you’ve exposed yourself as being a narcissist parasite. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However the smaller one is also more ambitious </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So way out of your league then. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(yet less gifted than me) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only because she didn’t text you back immediately. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>which makes us a better fit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. Ambitious people tend to do better with other ambitious people or at least with people who are intelligent and supportive. So that rules you out. You’re only ambition involves things that’ll grant you a lengthy prison sentence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would you pity them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One is being strung along by you and the other one is being stalked by you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still like her personality tho</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they can&#39;t all be flatchested nymphets :(</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your loss is a real man’s gain. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Probably not. I mean if he is she&#39;s treating him really badly which would be a warning to me. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah she doesn’t call senpai and doesn’t dress up like a sexualized 5 year old for him right? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I might subtly ask him about their status</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve been saying that for months. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just temporarily. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully she finds a real man who actually accepts her and likes her instead of treating her like garbage. Oh but wait you say you’re a “nice guy.” </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then for summer I get super shredded </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheese yeah I know. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and find a qt tiny one</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still haven’t managed to find one that’ll agree to be alone with you. Smart women. Just don’t on a shooting spree or become a serial rapist. Assuming you already aren’t the latter considering you did post pictures of children being abused.</p>
