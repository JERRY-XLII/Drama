    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d thought about the incident where Kimi claimed I&#39;d poked her pussy and how calm and casual she was about it, and the idea that she had wanted it and was turned on by me started making me more turned on by her. I asked her to hang out for a while on a following day in our usual hallway during her music class, asking to go to the washroom when she had some free time in the period. She did so and met me in the hallway where we were alone together. I told her I&#39;d been thinking about her and she really made my dick hard. She told me it was just chemicals and I&#39;d get over it. I told her that she was very sexy and I told her once more that I really wanted to touch her butt. She didn&#39;t seem surprised nor disgusted, but refused. I asked her if she&#39;d at least hug me and let me feel her breasts pressing up against me, to which she agreed. I was so turned on I knew I had to take the opportunity to grab her ass.</p>

<p>Shortly after I wrapped my arms around her waist for the hug, I slid my hands down to her butt cheeks and gently squeezed one in each of my hands. She kept her arms gently around me and after a second simply calmly said &quot;stop&quot;. After a couple squeezes, I let go. Shortly after that, she said she should get back to class. I told her that she had a really nice ass and it felt really good to touch it, to which she looked at me, smiled, and simply said &quot;thanks, I try&quot; before starting to walk away back to class. As she was approaching the doors to leave the hallway, I told her I was going to go jerk off to her in the washroom right away and she told me to enjoy myself. She got her brother to approach me the next day and tell me not to talk to her anymore, to which I was left speechless. I decided to just leave her alone. </p>

<p>Looking back on it, I should&#39;ve told Kimi &quot;oh I&#39;m so sorry, let me make it feel better&quot; and reached down between her thighs and started to gently rub her clit. I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what she&#39;d wanted and when I didn&#39;t react the way she wanted, that&#39;s when she started feeling less turned on around me.</p>
