<p>The whole propaganda thing was clearly a joke, and you took the hate thing too literally. Says a lot about your character.  </p>

<p>Also your only reason for “not being a fan” is “how she goes about things”. Try better next time. This also says a lot about you, or about as much as you can expect to assume from one comment, which you appear to take as a requirement for talking to you online.  </p>

<p>Top lad. cheers! Good job editing your original comment btw to be less cunty!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And ironic. Most of those judging this teenager either don’t understand the aggravation of climate change or they haven’t done anything to help. Like honestly, just ask them when was the last time they’ve recycled on their own without needing someone to tell them. Or when was the last time they said no, thanks to disposable plastics. Recycling is a way of supporting the cause, just like reducing the use of disposable plastics. This little girl has done far more than that and these guys sitting in front of their computer/smartphone don’t even think twice before spreading misinformation or before judging those who are fighting for a cause. Self-educate yourselves, my dudes. You literally have the tools to do it. Just use your computer or your smartphone to google what is climate change and how you can help instead of playing games and bringing down people who are actually making a change or at least trying to. My grandma always taught me not to speak of something if I don’t know what I’m speaking of. And thank god I always try to search the right information about something before commenting on it. That’s how you stop and fight misinformation, and it’s also how you can make a change if you have the proper intel on the issue. Just take 5 minutes of your life to learn something that will last 50 years of your life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Individuals can do symbolic gestures as individuals. The idea that recycling or turning down single use plastics has a significant impact is a fairly consumerist take on the situation. What happens, more often than not, is that you pay a little extra or make a little sacrifice to buy the feeling of being part of the solution.</p>

<p>Take recycling a plastic bottle for example. Here is what is happening:</p>

<p>• ⁠Drill brings up petroleum from the ground.
• ⁠Petroleum is transported to a refinery.
• ⁠Refinery separates the crude oil into usable materials.
• ⁠Some of those materials are transported to a petrochemical plant.
• ⁠The plant produces plastics from the petroleum product.
• ⁠Plastics are transported to a factory.
• ⁠Factory shapes the plastic and assembles it into a product. (there may be several stages of this)
• ⁠Product is transported to a warehouse.
• ⁠Warehouse then transports the product to a distribution center or retailer.
• ⁠Distro center or customer then transports the product to their home or office.
• ⁠Product is used for 15 minutes, then disposed.
• ⁠Disposed plastic is transported to a sorting facility.
• ⁠Plastic is sorted and shipped to a recycling center.
• ⁠Recycling center reclaims some of the raw materials and ships it to a factory.
• ⁠Factory assembles the plastic into a product. (there may be several stages of this)
• ⁠Product is transported to a warehouse.
• ⁠Warehouse transports the product to a distribution center or retailer.
• ⁠Individual transports the product to their home or office.
• ⁠Product is used again, then disposed of.</p>

<p>As is obvious, each of these steps comes at an environmental cost. Often the largest cost is in the actual mining of the resource, which is the argument in favor of recycling. Probably the most overlooked step here is the recycling center, which is as or more polluting as the chemical plant that produces the plastic the first time. Another overlooked aspect is the intense level of transportation, each requiring more petroleum. As products are rarely used near where they are manufactured, you&#39;re doubling that transportation each time you recycle. To put that in perspective, the 3 largest shipping barges on Earth produce more CO2 than all the cars on Earth combined.</p>

<p>Is this environmental, or is this just a more cost effective source of resources to continue to overproduce products and continue to ramp up consumerism under the guise of environmentalism?</p>

<p>There&#39;s really no effective way to resolve this problem without restructuring the above process, and there&#39;s no way to do that without restructuring the economic system that produced it.</p>
