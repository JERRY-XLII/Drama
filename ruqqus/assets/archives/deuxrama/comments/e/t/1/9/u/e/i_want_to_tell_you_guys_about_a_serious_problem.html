        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2020-01-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Popular-Profile.html">Popular-Profile</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday, I spent 3 hours talking to a moderator in r/AgainstHateSubreddits. We first were discussing this sub. The mod told me he thinks this sub is disgusting and toxic that makes fun of everyone. I first believed he was exaggerating. But after talking with him, I understand where he is coming from.</p>

<p>You guys always make fun of moderators. You belittle them by calling them internet janitors. Or you call them retards that work hours everyday for 0.00$</p>

<p>You also make fun of r/AgainstHateSubreddits users. You call them morons that advertise &quot;hate&quot; subreddits. Or you call them bunch of autistics that can&#39;t detect satire.</p>

<p>I am going to ask you guys for one thing. Just one simple thing. All I want from you is to put yourself in the other person&#39;s shoes. Before you post or comment anything on the internet, just spend 1 minute trying to picture the other person&#39;s life.</p>

<p>Most of these people you mock have terrible lives. And when r/DeuxRAMA mocks these people, you make them feel much worse than they already feel.</p>

<p>The r/AgainstHateSubreddits moderator that I spoke to, told me about their life. I got to understand them on a personal level. I am going to share with you their story. Of course, I won&#39;t mention which moderator it is exactly.</p>

<p>This moderator from r/AgainstHateSubreddits told me that when he was 12 years old, his father would constantly beat him and rape him. Can you imagine being raped by your own father for many years and having no one to help you? When he told me this and gave me details, I cried.</p>

<p>His life was so bad that this moderator eventually developed a defense mechanism to get his father to stop raping him. When his father would try to rape him, he would defecate himself. But this also caused him to defecate himself whenever he is stressed.</p>

<p>Even after many years passed, this moderator from r/AgainstHateSubreddits still defecates himself whenever he feels stressed. He is forced to wear adult diapers. And when people from this sub mocks this moderator and insults him, he feels stressed and he defecates himself. You people are torturing this man.</p>

<p>I believe we&#39;re better than this. We can be good people. Many of the people that we mocked are mentally damaged like this moderator. These people that we mock are trying to create a safe space so they no longer can be hurt. Again, all I ask is that you guys try to put yourselves in the other person&#39;s shoes.</p>

<p>I truly hope this encourages everyone to become a better person :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For your information, &quot;internet comments&quot; aren&#39;t some special kind of imaginary or play world. They are real comments from real people. This is still an actual conversation, genius, just like it was happening in someone&#39;s house, face to face. Maybe to you, it&#39;s just internet comments and comedy because you don&#39;t know what real life is. Look at your user name. Everything is just sarcasm to you. Look at your posts. You have no inner compass. Everything is just for a joke.</p>
