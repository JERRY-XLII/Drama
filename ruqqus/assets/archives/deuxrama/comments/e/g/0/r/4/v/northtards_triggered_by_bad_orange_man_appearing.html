<p>So you agree that Obama is the same level of asshole when his administration did it? Were you just as outraged back then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was not, unfortunately the media did not invest enough in covering this.</p>

<p>What I do know is that Obama’s Administration did not inflict unnecessary cruelty. Let us be frank. I’m a hard centrist. Hop a border without papers? I’m locking you up. God knows what you’re bringing in, that if you were processed under a FAIR immigration policy, could be addressed.</p>

<p>There is not a single answer anyone can provide that doesn’t end in some degree of cruelty. However, there is a difference between what I’ve read about the Obama Administration’s handling of the border, and the purposeful torture of families that are experiencing a severe economic downturn thanks to rich men playing games.</p>

<p>This argument is tired and moot as you will never address the fact that Trump cheated on almost every woman he ever was with. That one thing alone should boil your blood, before we address the only tax papers we have on him showing that he will lie about how many floors his buildings have.</p>

<p>I can do this all night and fuck citations, you know what I’m talking about. I’ll leave others to provide citations as Google is that easy, you are that dumb, and Bernie Sanders will be my next President.</p>
