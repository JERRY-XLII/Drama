    <div class="md"><p>For context this person attempted the usual game of not liking what you have to say, so they dig through several pages of comments as revenge and then post something that they can lie or take out of context. And when they were caught lying about that, they dug more because that&#39;s how they &quot;win&quot; and get revenge by proving you said something bad. And then they found it after several pages of comments, and after they found the offensive thing they were looking for they tried to guilt me with hurt feelings and suicide as if I feel anything at all or care. I used to have to try to troll and get under people&#39;s skin on the internet when I was a teenager, now they do it by themselves through normal conversation. Absolutely pathetic.</p>
