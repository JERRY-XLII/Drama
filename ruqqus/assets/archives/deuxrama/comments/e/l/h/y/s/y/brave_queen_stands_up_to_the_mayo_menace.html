<p>First things first, GET OFFLINE. The internet will only continue to feed the delusions and paranoia. I‚Äôm not sure what your insurance situation looks like but if you have it, go to your pcp and ask them to recommend you to a psychiatrist and get therapy and meds. There is NO SHAME WHATSOEVER in taking medication (another reason to stay offline, people will tell you not to take it) if you do not have insurance, see what type of services they provide for those without. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>FYI, as someone who has spent countless hours on dozens of accounts terrorizing schizophrenics on this site who engage in this sort of group delusion(I don&#39;t think most Qultists are mentally ill though), it&#39;s counterintuitive and anticlimactic but the most harmful thing you can do to them probably is to just rationally explain why none of this shit they&#39;re experiencing is real. This got a consistently way stronger response out of them than going to the other extreme and actually messaging them from multiple accounts and sending ominous messages reinforcing their stated delusions, which got me the most mildest responses. They barely cared and called me a troll. </p>

<p>I think that there might be some sort of process where they have to build their own faulty conclusions from the data at hand themselves in order to maximize the damage onto them, instead of you just repeating their fears back to them. You get to fuck with them while maintaining a virtuous facade and having people think highly of you for trolling them and stressing them the fuck out. Their brains are often literally structurally incapable of recognizing their own mental illness in the way that any of you would if something happened to you, so most of the time explaining doesn&#39;t do anything but satiate your own ego.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So fuck you. You think trolling online comes close to the blood sweat and tears I poured into getting a degree? I‚Äôm telling you what any trained therapist/PhD/ MD will tell you to stop watching the news and going to forums that will make their paranoia worse. And you are an asshole for trolling people like that. You are making it WORSE. So don‚Äôt you WVER y‚Äôall to me like you ain‚Äôt got no sense. It‚Äôs unfortunate how your mother raised you. Don‚Äôt say nothing else to me, period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok kween. IDGAF about your psychology bachelors, and I wasn&#39;t correcting u or care about u, I was teaching the rest of the deuxrama users how to harass these people. They probably didn&#39;t teach you that in your bachelors in psycholgy eediot. I don&#39;t do shit to people most of the time until they fuck with me first. This time the guy thought he would stalk and harass me and it would be smug fun owning me, and never thought I would do it to back to him and all his friends as innocent collateral damage but 100x worse as someone who gets fixated and does not stop. Or that retarded bitch with severe PTSD that ran her mouth so I sent a few choice comments, and months later she sees me and admits she&#39;s been so paranoid since then she thought I was repeatedly harassing her with alts which I never did. Too bad so sad. And my mom aint raise me like this bitch I turned out garbage on my own, u should know this sometimes happens if u so educated</p>
