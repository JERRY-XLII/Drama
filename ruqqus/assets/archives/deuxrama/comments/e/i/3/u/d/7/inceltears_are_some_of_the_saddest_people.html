    <div class="md"><p>Howdy, my name is Rawhide Kobayashi. I&#39;m a 27 year old Japanese Japamerican (western culture fan for you foreigners). I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle&#39;s hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nigga I know it&#39;s hard to believe outside of the r/childfree reddit hivemind but there are lots of people whose biggest aspiration in life is to raise kids and give them a <a href="https://www.mnpsych.org/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_dailyplanetblog%26view%3Dentry%26category%3Dindustry%2520news%26id%3D54">stable childhood</a> to carry on their legacy. It&#39;s pretty easy to <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/counterintuitive-trends-in-the-link-between-premarital-sex-and-marital-stability/">infer</a> that if raising a child is a priority to a person they shouldn&#39;t be choosing hoes to be the mother of their children. It&#39;s a big red flag to overlook and most people don&#39;t want to leave their aspirations in life to a game of roulette. Marrying a less promiscuous woman is a game of blackjack, much better odds.</p>

<p>How ironic to talk about sexual freedom while smugly rejecting the aspirations of people who value their reproductive freedom more. If reproduction was more important to you than sex your values and selection of partners would reflect that change in priority.</p>

<p>Why does &quot;experimenting with your sexuality&quot; for foids mean being pampered and serviced by a dozen bronzed Mediterranean studs while on holiday in Marbella, whereas the kind of sensual adventure open to us moids involves fellating an alcoholic pensioner in Preston bus station toilets for £10? :(</p>

<p>If your standards for a relationship are whether or not someone&#39;s enjoyed themselves without you before you met, you&#39;re have a genuinely childish and puritanical view of sex and I highly recommend trying to develop healthier views on it for your own sake and for the sake of anyone who happens to end up with you</p>
