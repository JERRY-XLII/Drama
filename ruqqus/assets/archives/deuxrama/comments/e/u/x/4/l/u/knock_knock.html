    <div class="md"><p>I used to work at an abortion clinic and I saw some extremely fucked up shit there which is why I&#39;m so anti-abortion now. This is just SOME of the horrible stuff I personally witnessed:</p>

<p>• ⁠A 23 year old woman came in 11 months into her pregnancy and said &quot;I don&#39;t want my stupid baby anymore, kill it&quot; and the doctor said &quot;okay&quot; and he put jumper cables up her baby hole and connected them to a car battery and let it run for six days straight </p>

<p>• ⁠A little 8-year old girl wandered in and said &quot;I want an abortion but I am not pregnant&quot; and the doctor said &quot;we&#39;ll fix that&quot; and he stole a baby and cut the girl open and put the baby inside her and sewed her shut and then woke the girl up and said &quot;congratulations it&#39;s a healthy six year old boy&quot; and the girl said &quot;can I keep him&quot; and the doctor said no and then backed over her in the parking lot with his brand new Ford Raptor </p>

<p>• ⁠They made me sign an agreement promising to stop drinking from the medical waste container (I signed somebody else&#39;s name) •   ⁠One of the doctors there developed a futuristic ray gun that could make anything he shot have an abortion, even trees, cars, or barns </p>

<p>• ⁠The receptionist threw nail polish at an elderly man</p>

<p>• ⁠The doctor&#39;s assistant invented this thing she called &quot;the silly slide&quot; and it was a really fun little water slide that connected a woman&#39;s vagina to a paper shredder so a newborn baby could briefly &quot;enjoy the high life&quot; </p>

<p>• ⁠The oldest child we aborted was in his late 70s, we didn&#39;t even know he was a baby until his wife brought in photos</p>

<p>• ⁠The doctors put all sorts of crap up a woman&#39;s uterus including a clown nose, bicycle handlebars, a calendar, and an entire Sears retail outlet (before bankruptcy) </p>

<p>• ⁠During every successful abortion, the doctor would shout &quot;take that, baby&quot; and he&#39;d push a red button that made sirens go off and confetti fell from the ceiling and we&#39;d all get Del Taco for free</p>

<p>I have more stories but I&#39;m watching a movie with James Spader and it requires all my attention because he may be Jack the Ripper</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accidentally did a hydrogen peroxide Enema. I&#39;m very concerned. I poured 35% peroxide Into my bag yesterday to let it sit and clean. This morning I didn&#39;t pay attention and just added water to the bag and started the enema. I had totally forgotten i was letting it clean. I do t ever do this. I always boil my bag. I noticed an immediate burn so cinched it off and couldn&#39;t make it to the toilet in time it expelled. I had no clue why this was happening. I had immediate dry heaves rectally and also throwing up. I then realized what I&#39;d done. I thought if I tried to do a water enema to clean it out it would help but it burned so bad and the water came flying out of me. So I am now bleeding rectally when I can release some waste it&#39;s bloody. I have been on google. I think I&#39;m going to be ok. But has anyone else had issues from this? Please don&#39;t scare me. Be nice. This was a total accident.</p>
