<p>How a priest changed Kobe Bryant’s life</p>

<p>On Wednesday, April 13, 2016, Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest athletes of all time, ended his 20-year basketball career with a bang, scoring 60 points in his last game.</p>

<p>While Bryant’s stats can be recited by many — five-time NBA champion, two-time Olympic champion, 18-time All-Star and the third leading scorer in NBA history — few know about the role his Catholic faith played in helping him through one of his darkest hours.</p>

<p>Born in Philadelphia, Kobe Bryant was raised in a Catholic household and even spent some of his youth in Italy. Drafted into the NBA at the age of 17, he eventually married Vanessa Laine at St. Edward Roman Catholic Church in Dana Point, California. Two years later they had their first child. Bryant was at the top of his game and everything seemed to be heading in the direction of his dreams.</p>

<p>Then he made a big mistake.</p>

<p>In 2003, Kobe Bryant was accused of raping a woman in his hotel room, while he was in Colorado for knee surgery. He admitted having sex with the woman but denied rape. A judge eventually dropped the charges, but the woman went on to file a civil lawsuit against Bryant that was settled outside of court. In the midst of it all, he issued a public apology, stating that he was sincerely ashamed of what he had done.</p>

<p>The incident had major consequences as numerous sponsors abandoned him and his reputation was tarnished. In 2011, his wife filed for divorce.</p>

<p>Yet during one of the darkest moments of his life, Kobe Bryant turned to his Catholic faith. In an interview with GQ in 2015 he explained:</p>

<p>“The one thing that really helped me during that process — I’m Catholic, I grew up Catholic, my kids are Catholic — was talking to a priest. It was actually kind of funny: He looks at me and says, ‘Did you do it?’ And I say, ‘Of course not.’ Then he asks, ‘Do you have a good lawyer?’ And I’m like, ‘Uh, yeah, he’s phenomenal.’ So then he just said, ‘Let it go. Move on. God’s not going to give you anything you can’t handle, and it’s in his hands now. This is something you can’t control. So let it go.’ And that was the turning point.”</p>

<p>After some rough years, Kobe Bryant reconciled with his wife, and they remain married to this day. Together they have founded the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation (KVBFF), which is dedicated to, among other things, helping young people in need, encouraging the development of physical and social skills through sports and assisting the homeless. Asked about this commitment in 2013, Bryant’s answer would likely have made Pope Francis very happy:</p>

<p>My career is winding down. At the end of my career, I don’t want to look back and just say, “Well, I had a successful career because I won so many championships and scored so many points.” There’s something else that you have to do with that.</p>

<p>[The homelessness] issue is one that kind of gets pushed on the back burner because it’s easy to point the blame at those who are homeless and say, “Well, you made that bad decision. This is where you are. It’s your fault.” In life, we all make mistakes and to stand back and allow someone to live that way and kind of wash your hands of it … that’s not right.</p>

<p>Throughout all of his trials, and perhaps even in response to them, Bryant has realized that fame and fortune were nothing compared to the importance of faith and family. When everyone else in the world abandoned him, the Catholic Church was always there.</p>

<p>He may be an All-Star and NBA legend, but even superstars can use the foundational support of faith-formation, and a good priest to turn to.</p>

<p>His Holiness Leo XIII says in his Encyclical Humanum Genus exactly as follows: “The Popes, our forefathers, who bore conscientious concern for the spiritual salvation of the Christian peoples, soon knew very well who this deadly enemy was and what he wished, even if he hardly ever came out of the darkness of his secret conspiracy into the light, and accordingly, when he had spread his word of revolution, they exhorted princes and peoples to caution that they might not allow themselves to be caught by the malicious arts and traps which were prepared to deceive them. The first announcement of the danger was given in the year 1738 by Pope Clement XII (Constitution In Eminenti, 24th April 1738), which order Benedict XIV confirmed and renewed (Constitution Providas, 18th May 1751). Pius VII (Constitution Ecclesiam a Jesu Christi, 13th September 1821) followed the path of both, and Leo XII, who in the Apostolic Constitution Quo Graviora (Constitution given 13th March 1825) incorporated in this material the decrees passed by his predecessors, authorized and confirmed the same for ever. Pius VIII (Encyclical Traditi, 21st May 1829), Gregory XVI (Encyclical Mirari, 15th August 1835), and Pius IX</p>

<p>(Encyclical Qui Pluribus, 9th November 1816; Allocution Multiplices Inter, 25th September 1865, etc.) naturally spoke repeatedly in the same sense. “According to the example of our predecessors, we have now resolved to openly turn ourselves against the Freemasonic society, against the system of their doctrine, against their manner of feeling and acting, to ever more make clear their harmful power and thus to prevent infection by such a destructive plague. “The good tree can bring forth no bad fruits, nor can the bad tree bring forth good fruits (Matth. Chapter VII. v. 18) and the fruits of the Freemasonry sects are harmful and in addition very sour. For, from the completely reliable proofs that we have mentioned previously, is revealed the ultimate and last and most principal of their intentions, namely: To destroy to their foundations every religious and civic order that has been erected by Christianity, and after their own manner to erect a new order with foundations and laws, which they took from the essence of Naturalism... The confusing errors, which we have enumerated, must already suffice in themselves to fill the States with anxiety and fear. For, if the fear of God and respect for the laws is abolished, if the authority of the princes is despised, if the madness of revolution is called good and is declared as lawful, if with the greatest unbridledness the passions of the peoples are unchained, without other hindrance than punishment, then universal upheaval and disorder must necessarily follow. And it is particularly this upheaval and disorder that is planned and put forward by many associations of Communists and Socialists, of whose plans it cannot be said that they are remote from the sect of the Freemasons, since they favour the latter’s intentions in great measure and agree with them on the most fundamental principles... “However this may be, worthy brothers, as far as concerns us in the face of such a heavy and already widespread evil, we must be diligent with our entire soul in seeking for aid. And since we know, that the best and foremost hope of aid is placed in the power of the divine religion, which is hated by the Freemasons in the same way as it is feared, we hold it to be essential that we stand in service of this healing power against the common enemy. Everything accordingly that all the Popes</p>

<p>our predecessors have ordered to hold up the attempts and efforts of the Freemasonic Sects, everything which they praised to keep men away from such societies or entice them from them, we strengthen and confirm individually and entirely with our Papal authority.”1 As one sees, both his Holiness Leo XIII as well as various earlier Popes are very clear in their condemnation of Freemasonry and recognise simultaneously the latter’s intentions, in association with Socialists and Communists, to destroy Christianity. And who directs Freemasonry? the Jews.</p>

<p>JEWISH ORIGIN “The rites and symbols of the Freemasons and of the other secret sects remind one constantly of the ‘Cabbala’ (secret Jewish mystique) and Jewry: The reconstruction of the temple of Solomon, the star of David, the seal of Solomon; the names of the different degrees, as for example, Knight Kadosh. ‘Kadosh’ means in Hebrew ‘holy’; Prince of Jerusalem, Prince of Lebanon, Knight of the serpent of Airain, etc. And does not</p>

<p>the prayer of the English Freemasons, which was recorded in an assembly held in 1663, recall Judaism in a most clear manner?”5 “Finally the Scottish Freemasons made use of the Jewish calendar; for example, a book, which was written by the American Freemason Pike6 in the year 1881, is dated ‘Anno mundi 5641’. At present this calendar is retained only in the highest degrees, while the Freemasons in general add four thousand years to the Christian calendar, and not 3760 like the Jews.”7 The clever Rabbi Benamozegh writes the following: “Those who wish to make the effort to examine the questions of relations between Jewry and philosophic Freemasonry, between Theosophy and the secret doctrines in general, will lose a little of their arrogant despisal of the Cabbala (Jewish Mysticism). They will cease to smile contemptuously at the idea that the ‘Cabbalistic’ theology perhaps has to fulfil a mission in the religious re-shaping of the future.”8 “Who are the true leaders of Freemasonry? This is one of the secrets of the sect, which is very carefully kept; but one can assert that Freemasonry all over the world develops in agreement with one and the same plan; that its methods are always and in all parts identical, and that the aims pursued are permanently the same. This occasioned us to believe that a uniform middlepoint exists, which directs all movements of the Sect. “Further on we will touch upon this question; however, here let us recall that ‘Carta de Colonia’, dated 24th June 1935, speaks of a director of Freemasonry: the Grandmaster or patriarch, who, although known by very few brothers, exists in reality; and Gougenot des Mousseaux points out that ‘this choice of the Order, these real directors, whom only a very few initiates know, exercise their function in useful and secret dependency upon the Israelite Cabbalists (Mystics)’ (page 338-339) and that the true directors of Freemasonry are the friends, the helpers and the vassals of the Jew to whom they do homage as their highest Lords. The same judgment is shared by Eckert, Drumont, Deschamps, Msgr. Jouin, Lambelin and other</p>

<p>savants of Freemasonic and Jewish questions”.9 Let us leave the dogmatic teachings of the Freemasons and Jewry to one side and let us examine the alliances between both from the purely practical and realistic standpoint. If one proceeds logically, one cannot avoid drawing the conclusion which is formulated by L. de Poncins in “The Secret Powers Behind Revolution.” “The manifoldness of Freemasonry, its permanence, the inalterability of its goals, which are completely explicable since it is a question of a Jewish creation to serve the Jewish interests, would be completely incomprehensible if its origin were of a Christian nature. “Even the purpose in itself of Freemasonry, namely the destruction of Christian civilisation, reveals to us the Jew, for only the Jew can draw advantage from it, and the Jew alone is inspired by a sufficiently violent hatred towards Christianity to create such an organisation.” “Freemasonry”, continues de Poncins, “is a secret society and is directed by an international minority. It has sworn Christianity an irreconcilable hatred. These three characteristics are exactly the same as those that describe Jewry and represent the proof that the Jews are the leading element of the lodges.”10 Already in 1867 the “permanent international league for peace” came into existence, and its secretary, the Jew Passy, outlined the ideas of a court of justice, to settle all conflicts between the nations without appeal.11 The newspaper “The Israelite Archive” dreamed of a similar court of justice in the year 1864. “Is it not natural and necessary” — wrote a certain Levy Bing — “that as soon as possible we see erected an additional court of justice, and in fact a highest court of justice, to whom the great open conflicts and the quarrels among the nations are submitted, which in the last instance passes judgment, and whose last word is given powerful weight? This will be the word of God, which is uttered by his first-born sons (the Hebrews), and before which the general rest of mankind will bow in respect before our brothers, our friends and our pupils.”12</p>

<p>These are the dreams of Israel. As always they accord with those of Freemasonry. The “Freemasons calendar” writes: “When the Republic has been set up in the whole of old Europe, Israel, as ruler will rule over this old Europe.”13 At the world congress of Jewish youth, which was held on 4th August 1928, H. Justin Godard announced that the Jews were the firmest supporters of the League of Nations, which had to thank its existence to them.”14 The Jew Cassin gave more exact information: “The rebirth of Zionism is the work of the League of Nations. Through it the Jewish organisations place themselves as defenders of the League of Nations, and therefore Geneva swarms with representatives of the ‘chosen people’.”15 The most venerable Cardinal Jose Maria Caro R., Archbishop of Santiago and Primate of Chile, also proves, in his authoritatively supported work “The Secret of Freemasonry”, that it is the Jews who direct this sect, in order to rule the world and to destroy Holy Church. In connection with its origin he affirms: “The Freemasonic rite clearly betrays its Jewish origin: the symbols, which begin with the Bible itself; the coat of arms upon which an attempt is made to explain the different forms of the Cherubim described by Ezekiel in his second poem, an ox, a man, a lion and an eagle; the two pillars of the Freemasonic temple in remembrance of the temple of Solomon; the rebuilding of the temple which is the work of the Freemasons, etc. The reading matter and the handbooks, which in greater part are taken from the Bible, they turn almost always towards Freemasonic taste, especially the legend of Hiram, which plays an important role in the Freemasonic rite. “The customary words and expressions, like the names of the pillars ‘Boaz’ and ‘Jachin’, the words of knowledge and of admittance: Tubalcain, Shibboleth, Giblim or Moahon, Nekum or Nekam, Abibalc, etc; the importance, which is allotted to numbers, a matter very original to the Cabbala, all these are further proofs of the Cabbalistic influence on Freemasonry. “Finally the facts, the rule of terror, the outbreak of Satanic hatred against the Church, against our Lord Jesus Christ, the</p>

<p>terrible blasphemies against God that the revolutionary Freemasons perpetrated in France, are nothing more than the expression and the fulfilment of the Cabbalistic and secret sects, which already for several centuries have fought secretly against Christianity. What the Jewish Bolshevists to greatest part do in Russia against Christianity, is only another edition of the deeds of the Freemasons in the French revolution. The executioners are others; however the doctrine that motivates and empowers them and the supreme leadership are the same</p>

<p>And what do the jews have to say about blcks</p>

<p>Jewish Clergy and Black Slavery “The pursuit of wealth in slaves and usury not only violated Jewish ethics but destroyed the rough democracy imposed upon a people in exile. Initially, the Jews looked to their rabbis and scholars for guidance. Eventually, the aristocracy of learning gav e way to the aristocracy of wealth. Leadersh ip of the community passed from the wise man to the rich man, a curse of organizational Jewry even today.&quot; 5 48 The slavery debate raged acro ss the country but no Jewish leader s of the Old South &quot;ever expr essed any reservations about the justice of slavery or the rightness of the Southern 54 9 position.&quot; Jewish clergy did not even discuss Blackslavery until 1860, and then primarily in support of it.5 50 Arthur Hertzberg sums up their position: As was to be expected, the Jewish clergy in the South, without exception, endorsed the Confeder- acy. These preachers, most of whom were quite recent immigrants from Germany, summoned up great pass ion in their defens e of states&#39; rights. They repeated the conventional platitudes of that day, that the black race was incapable of taking care of itself, that s lavery was a way of discharging the 545 Korn, Civil War was correct.&quot; 546 Korn, Civil War 547 Feuerlicht, p. 187. 548 Feuerlicht, p. 39. 549 Abraham J. Karp, , p. 15; Feldstein, The Land That I Show You , p. 15. Haven and Home: A History of Jews in Amer ica , p. 96, agrees : &quot;For the mostpart, the statemen t (New York: Schocken Books, 1985), p. responsibility of whites toward their childlike inferiors... The Secret Relationship between Blacks and Jews 107 Rev. J. M. Michelbacher was completely convinced of the justice of Negro slavery, and Rabbi George Jacobs of Richmond, Virginia [144] owned and rented slaves. 5 52 Rabbi Raphall called those who opposed it &quot;blasphemous.” 553 Rev. A. Grunzberg of Rochester wrote a letter complaining of the &quot;high standing politicians who are very zealous for the half- civilized Negro, [but] so illiberal against our nation.&quot; 55 4 Rabbis Simon Tuska of Memphis and James K. Gutheirn of New Orleans both defended the enslavement of Blacks to their congre- 5 55 gations. Gutheim, the most distinguished of the South&#39;s Jewish cler gyman, chose to move his family to the home of his inlaws in Mobile rather than take an oath of allegiance to the United States and the &quot;Dictator of Washington,&quot; Abraham Lincoln.556 Similarly, Rev. Henry S. Jacobs, who had served Beth Shalome of Richmond for three years (1854-1857) bef ore mov- ing on to Charleston, denounced Rev. Samuel Isaacs of New York f or writing an appeal f or loyalty to the Union.557 All twenty-one Southern Jewish congregations were staunchly Confederate and of those in the North there is no recor d of any [145] official rebuke of the slave system. Kagan- off and Urofsky&#39;s , Turn to the South : The Northern rabbinate remained divided on the issue. Isaac Leeser - living in Philadelphia but with strong ties to Richmond - tried hard to remain aloof and neutral and was condemned by both sides .558 Rabbi Bernard Illowy, distinguished leader of Baltimore&#39;s Orthodox Hebrew Congre- gation,defendedthe statusquo.Thoughhedidnotpreachsecessionhediddeclarehisopen sympathy f or the secessionists and their Negro property rights: Who can blame our brethren of the South for seceding from a society whose government cannot or will not protect the property, rights and privileges of a great portion of the Union against the en- croachments of a majority misguided by some influential, ambitious aspirants and selfish politicians who, under the color of religion and the disguise of philanthropy, have thrown the country into a general state of confusion, and millions into want and poverty?</p>

<p>Saying he wouldnt mind being jewish?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=44">http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=44</a></p>

<p>but at the. rnd of the day we know what</p>

<p>Everyone has dreams of what they&#39;ll be when they grow up. Firefighters and astronauts (and pirates, apparently) are fairly typical. In Japan, an inordinate number of children want to pilot giant robots when they grow up (now there&#39;s a recipe for disappointment). When we were growing up, we wanted to be writers. Hey, sometimes this stuff just works out.</p>

<p>Certainly, a common American dream is to be a pro basketball star. We didn&#39;t have that dream. Maybe because the reality of being short, Jewish and unathletic was too heavy a load, even for dreams. But a lot of kids today do. Which means a lot of kids today are in for a letdown.</p>

<p>And the kids who do make it to the NBA to live out their dream? What do they dream about? Well, according to a 2006 interview, Kobe Bryant &quot;wouldn&#39;t mind being Jewish.&quot;</p>

<p>Really, Kobe?</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind. Really.&quot;</p>

<p>OK, then... Hey, in a world where &quot;giant robot pilot&quot; is considered acceptable, even expected, maybe Kobe&#39;s dreams aren&#39;t too far fetched.</p>

<p>But we think he&#39;d be better off sticking to basketball.</p>

<p>Verdict: Not a Jew.</p>

<p>so what was he doing there?</p>
