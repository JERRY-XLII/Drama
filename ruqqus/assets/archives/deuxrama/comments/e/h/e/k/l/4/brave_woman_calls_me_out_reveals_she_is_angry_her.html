    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not gonna say anything, just that BPD revolves around most if not all of your emotions being at 100% intensity and a 24/7 fear of the people close to you abandoning you which would make you sucidial. Both due to the pathology of the  runaway emotions of the disease, and the reality of people with BPD stabbing every person that gets close them in the back.</p>

<p>So if I had BPD it would ruin my day or even multiple days if you were to dig through my comments, find where I mention an emotional connection to anyone I valued in my life, and then repeatedly sent me messages assuring that  this specific person I would drive them away as usual and cause them to abandon me, and end up alone as I was destined to. The more personal details you would use to craft the messages the worse it would be.</p>

<p>I said literally only that I don&#39;t care. But you have extrapolated these strawmen from me merely saying I don&#39;t care, because you literally can&#39;t tell the difference between not caring and understanding, and not caring because you don&#39;t understand.

<p>While I&#39;m sure a significant factor in BPD is childhood trauma, I also doubt that it is physical punishment causing that. Most people with BPD are female, if anything it would be sexual abuse that would lead to BPD. From the women with that condition that I&#39;ve met a few that claimed to have suffered physical abuse, but many more were consistent in that they had suffered sexual abuse. Girls aren&#39;t typically punished as physically as boys. If it was physical abuse causing BPD, and not sexual abuse + social factors, then you would expect to see males be the ones commonly suffering from BPD, but it is the exact opposite. I&#39;ve never met a man traumatized for being hit as a kid (although they obviously exist depending on if those punishments went overboard), but have met many men with Pseudo-BPD symptoms who were the exact opposite, never punished or disiplined or emotionally guided by their parents. Usually they come from single mother households. </p>

<p>I highly doubt BPD rates have been doing anything but increasing. Now maybe that is due to proper diagnosis, even though BPD often isn&#39;t diagnosed and it is labelled into Bi-polar depression instead. But still, I don&#39;t think any evidence exists that BPD has been decreasing as physical punishments for children has been. Another factor in all of this to consider is the cultural promotion of BPD by pop idols like Billie Eilish. It is entirely possible that BPD has been decreasing, but diagnoses increasing as it became a cultural phenomenon, a way for young women to be cool and quirky. I&#39;m not a social scientist or psychologist who has been thoroughly researching this to be making authoritative claims, and my original comment was in no way intended to claim that I was, but that regardless of what is causing BPD we should be empathetic to what a truly terrible disease it is for the person suffering it and everyone else around them who has to be dragged down into it the depravity. That was the purpose of my comment to you. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah, and that is the problem, that for some reason you think it is acceptable to not care that your fellow humans are being dragged into depravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you have extrapolated these strawmen from me merely saying I don&#39;t care, because you literally can&#39;t tell the difference between not caring and understanding, and not caring because you don&#39;t understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I understand the difference between the two. The same way a communist would would know about churches being set a blaze, priests being burned alive in revolutionary Calatonia, but not care. That still doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t wrong to think in such an egotistical way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which also implies that you think feelings imbue you with knowledge on the subject, which is on the level of believing in astrology faggot. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well no fucking shit astrology is real and that feelings are knowledge. Feelings alone have driven 99% of the human experience. If you don&#39;t acknowledge that then you probably aren&#39;t even fully human. How many people are these fully physchopathetic calculating machines? Not many, and they shouldn&#39;t be. The human experience is a lived experience driven by feelings, not some numbers a scientist types on a spreadsheet. I reject the idea entirely that empiricism and analytics command us.  </p>

<p>Yeah, and I could make the same argument back to you, that you use this aura of understanding but not caring to prop yourself up as some sort of cunning intellectual.
