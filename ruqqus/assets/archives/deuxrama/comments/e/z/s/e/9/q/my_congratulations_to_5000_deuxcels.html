    <div class="md"><p>I just downvoted your comment.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>What does this mean?</h2>

<p>The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.</p>

<h2>Why did you do this?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rudeness towards other Redditors,</li>
<li>Spreading incorrect information,</li>
<li>Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a <code>/s</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Am I banned from the Reddit?</h2>

<p>No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.</p>

<h2>I don&#39;t believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?</h2>

<p>Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</p>

<h2>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</h2>

<p>Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came out to my family that I&#39;m into anal vore.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a male in my early 20&#39;s. If you were to ask me who I am, the 1st thing I would instantly say is &quot;l am an anal vore fanatic&quot;. Its who I am. It‚Äôs my identity. Anal vore is my life, and it felt important enough for me to tell my friends and family. I decided the best way to tell them would be to have an anal vore &quot;coming-out party&quot;, though didn&#39;t tell them that the party was going to be about anal vore ahead of time. I&#39;m not stupid. I knew they would look it up in Google and see a bunch of stupid things and criticisms by trolls about it, so I decided that to make the best impression of anal vore I would have to present it to them myself.</p>

<p>I ordered pizzas and planned a lot of fun activities we could do that would explain to my friends and family what anal vore is.</p>

<p>It started when they came in through the door. I gave everyone a sealed envelope and told them not to open it until I said so. When everyone had arrived (grandparents, aunts and uncles, my parents, 3 of my cousins, and a couple non-family friends), I announced what the purpose of the party was and had them open the envelopes. I had commissioned a popular artist that I really like to draw sketches of each of my family members/friends anal voring me, and printed these pictures out and put them in the envelope (he agreed to do the sketches for $5/each BTW so it wasn&#39;t too expensive for me). Everyone kinda laughed and a couple of them were confused when explained (my grandpa got kind of mad at me though). I basically explained to them that I&#39;m into anal vore and what it is. I don&#39;t think they took it very well though because they joked a lot about it (they kept asking if I was serious or if I was joking). A couple people (my parents and grandparents mostly) seemed upset though, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The next part of the party was I hooked up my laptop to my TV with an HDMI cable and I started showing them my favorite anal vore pictures that I had saved on my computer. This is where the party kind of took a turn for the worse. One of my uncles got really mad and started calling me names (l don&#39;t want to repeat them here) but my aunt defended me.</p>

<p>We argued for a bit and most of my family left at that point... I kept showing them the anal vore pictures I saved but they started leaving and only my cousins and close friends chose to remain and look at the pictures with me. What did I do wrong? Is this basically something that only younger people enjoy? Because I&#39;m pretty sure my grandparents hated anal vore (l still love them though even if we can&#39;t see eye to eye on this subject that&#39;s extremely important to me).</p>

<p>Anyways the next part of the party that I had planned for so long and was expecting to be a bit hit was a kind of interactive anal-vore reading game. I had printed out one of my favorite anal vore stories and wanted to pass around the story and we would all read a part aloud, but that didn&#39;t really go as planned. One of my cousins said they thought it was &quot;creepy&quot;...? I tried to convince her that it&#39;d be cool but no one wanted to do it. I had to read the story myself but when they started talking to each other about things NOT related to anal vore I kind of gave up</p>

<p>The party kind of fizzled out. We just watched TV for a bit, I kept talking about anal vore a bit (but not as much as I wanted) and after the party was over everyone (the people who were left at the end, anyway) finally left.</p>

<p>Did I do anything wrong? Should I try to do the party again, because I think they may have interpreted my interest wrong? It‚Äôs really important for me and I want them to know, but how can I communicate my love of anal vore to my family members who are specifically picky about such issues, such as my uncle who was intolerant of me? Any advice would be greatly appreciated</p>
