You idiots post links to anything that matches up with your gay ass drama buzzwords. I don’t get how the circlejerk of regulars don’t get bored of this place but I guess that is because of their incredibly low mental capacity.

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, thank you for helping clarify why so many people so consistently get this wrong.</p>

<p>You&#39;re starting at the definition of a word and trying to force reality to fit it.  There are many valid concepts that get the &quot;female&quot; label and some of them contradict each other. If our language wasn&#39;t so dumb we&#39;d have more common terms to differentiate when we&#39;re talking about chromosomal sex, primary physical sexual characteristics, secondary physical characteristics, gender expression, gender identity, body (dis)morphia... </p>

<p>But we don&#39;t. Insisting everyone use a particular definition when there are many valid ones doesn&#39;t make them wrong, it just means you need them to provide more context cues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s... not really how my argument went. I was saying there are some definitions of female that are more synonymous with woman than others.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a fun game: You give a definition for female and I bet I can give an example for why your definition doesn&#39;t mean what you want it to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If womanhood is social construct than a person who attempts to achieve it through excessive surgery, pills, and obsessivley performing a made up (and mysognyistic) social role is clearly mentally ill and hurting themselves. In fact an unhealthy obsession with performing womanhood and the idea that ones personality must match ones social role is inheritely problematic and delusional if it is just an artificial human construct. And dont try to weasel out of this with muh sex is different than gender, sex is your gentials and gender is the role/personality. If gender is a social construct than nobody should have some deep inherint identity and gender with, certainty nobody should try to transition from one made up role to the other, and obviously there is no actual basis to objectively argue someone&#39;s gender being female. The fact that you are so intent on defending a transexuals gender is telling. And if you try to back pedal and claim that men and woman are actually so mentally different, different brains, people are born in the wrong body ect than you&#39;re endorsing a conservative position that most of your ilk would consider bigoted and basically a fireable offense. If I said in some totally unrelated conversation that male and female brains are different and womens brains are programmed to make them act feminine and take on traditional gender roles, you would call me a mysogynist- if I was  scientist and I said that I would probably get fired. The degree doesn&#39;t mean shit when your brain is so obviously corroded with toxic ideology.</p>
