I hate you and everything you stand for, you fucking devolved orangutan wasting everyones time. Instead of constantly spewing nonsense, pick up a book and learn something, you IDIOT. I have never met someone that&#39;s as much as an absolute CRETIN as you.

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine if I get to dance at clubs with my wife and wear heels, have women tugging and touching me all night, and right now, my retirement plan is to donate sperm to my willing fans at $35k a pop?</p>

<p>Why can you not just step up and be at least on the level of the average Pajeet when you make bullshit like this?</p>

<p>Have you ever even been in love properly? Had a woman willing to let you cum in her throat while she fingers your G spot?  </p>

<p>Much to learn, you have, young Padawan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your brother is dead. he suffered his entire life, abandoned by his father and family at a young age. you know what kind of radical changes in the brain such early abandonment causes? then his wife emotionally and probably physically tortured him until he killed himself. your brother knew nothing but pain and suffering in his relatively short time on earth and had to stop his own breathing to make it end. </p>

<p>and many people are happy about it. did he leave his wife any assets that she can spend on her new man that she was probably already seeing before he died? why don&#39;t you give him a call and ask him how he&#39;s doing? oh wait you can&#39;t, because he&#39;s in the ground a half decayed corpse by now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the cutest attempt at trying to trigger me. </p>

<p>In reality, he toured the world, fucked a lot of pussy (his ex woman actually had the nerve to ask me to donate sperm since her man can&#39;t do it), was called &quot;Teacher Chocolate&quot; in Taiwan because he taught English to their kids...</p>

<p>Honestly, when I see people like you try to come at him, I simply smile that a good man like that is now with his maker, where he belongs. You&#39;re stuck here being so shitty of a person that my entire existence triggers you into revealing how sad of an individual you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>is that why you downvoted me, blocked people who talked shit about your dead brother, and are trying so aggressively to make it look like you don&#39;t care when i say shit like this. very believable. that&#39;s usually what people are known to do when they don&#39;t care, they invoke automated scripts to shield them from the words that aren&#39;t affecting them</p>

<p>and yet again, he aggressively &quot;doesn&#39;t care&quot; so much that he&#39;s privately messaging me to brag about his life to show how unfazed he is. he won&#39;t do this whole dance over normal racist abuse, but he always makes sure to emphasize how much he &quot;doesn&#39;t care&quot; when it comes to this topic. ok.</p>
