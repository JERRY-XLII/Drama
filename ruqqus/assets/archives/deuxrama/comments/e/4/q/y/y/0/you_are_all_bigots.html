Ob*se is NOT a medical term and this woman (ft in photo) doesn‚Äôt use the term (she doesn‚Äôt use ‚Äòunder or overweight‚Äô either ‚Äî because over WHAT weight?). These are subjective terms unless you‚Äôre talking about BMI which was developed by insurance companies and later adopted by the medical community for lack of better descriptors. There is a large and educated movement of people who are deciding not to use these arbitrary terms which are more often used in judgement and discrimination. / posted by a straight sized person who believes people can be healthy at many shapes and sizes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm a thin/straight-sized, highly educated, liberal leaning person. Used to be fatphobic, orthorexic (obsessed with health and clean eating), and very judgemental. Started reading. Stopped subscribing to diet culture. Started following people like @drjoshuawolrich (highly recommend), have a new POV and am a much happier and healthier person‚Äî best part? More tolerant and compassionate. Antivaxxers are idiots. I like your comment about being inclusive about those with physical disabilities. This is a big part of the body acceptance movement as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good Q. Appreciate your asking. I don‚Äôt mean visually ‚Äústraight‚Äù ‚Äî ‚Äòstraight sized‚Äô is the acceptable term used within the body positive community to describe someone who might otherwise be described as ‚Äúnormal sized‚Äù. It‚Äôs meant to sound less superior. More neutral. Typically a straight-sizes person will be an American size 4-10. They may appear thin, curvy, muscular or even a little fat... but they move through the world with more ease than ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù or ‚Äúunderweight‚Äù and live without as much scrutiny or emphasis placed on their body (eg, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs so skinny!‚Äù Or ‚Äúshe needs to lose weight!‚Äù)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t know what became of her. She was pretty into the wineaunt/dogmom lifestyle and she really didn&#39;t like kids so maybe she stayed childfree but you are probably right. We were together for 4 years and when I first found out she was 21 I was like, &quot;oh no, chicks change and when you turn 25 you are going to realize that you don&#39;t want to be with a snowboarding drug dealer anymore and you are going to break my heart&quot; and I called that shit perfectly. Exactly what happened. She sure was a keeper though. Smart, fun and hot af.</p>
