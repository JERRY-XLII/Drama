    <div class="md"><p>The entire country was a house of cards built upon their respect for a single war hero from WW2 and not a national identity. As soon as that guy dies and people realize they&#39;re poor, it&#39;s time to start seceding and get away from these other ethnic groups who don&#39;t give a fuck about me. And since you&#39;re seceding, I might as well get revenge on you for trying to exterminate me in WW2 as the master race Or since Muslims from Turkey exterminated me 150 years ago, I might as well take this opportunity to exterminate you(not Turks) now.</p>

<p>If you want to find a comparable example look for any unstable multi-ethnic society that was invented that way on purpose by European colonizers, such as Rwanda. Which really describes much of the middle east or Africa.</p>

<p>Like how white people colonized so many countries? Will they soon face vengeance? Seems like that&#39;s what the rhetoric is brooding.</p>

<p>We have seen the attacks on jews in new york, by certain locals.</p>

<p>This is happening outside of us. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anders Behring Breivik’s manifesto, 2083: A European Declaration of Independence, which he wrote under the name of Andrew Berwick, is 1500 pages long, incredibly professionally produced and deals with the main “far right” talking points of the time, which were Cultural Marxism and the Islamisation of Europe.   </p>

<p><a href="https://www.europeanfreedom.com/2019/03/30/brenton-tarrant-and-anders-breivik-coincidences-between-the-new-zealand-and-norway-attacks/">https://www.europeanfreedom.com/2019/03/30/brenton-tarrant-and-anders-breivik-coincidences-between-the-new-zealand-and-norway-attacks/</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I crazy, or could that have been written today. </p>

<p>Then we have the other vikang Tarrant </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brenton Tarrant’s The Great Replacement is just under 90 pages long and only runs to 16,500 words so it is no near as ambitious as 2083: A European Declaration of Independence. It also contains quite a few typos and is a much less “professional” piece of work. However, it does fully explain the current “far right” talking point, which is the replacement of the indigenous peoples of Europe in their ancestral homelands by low IQ foreign migrants. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Years apart, in different countries, but carrying the same sentiment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe South Africa once climate change starts to fuck their already pitiful lives up and the Marxist-Leninist party starts to get more votes </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont believe climate change has sown racial discord in SA. Climate change will however be used as a talking point especially as a reason for people to take in refugees, im 100% certain of that. </p>

<p>I think blacks beating jews for being jews is anti-semitic. I think blacks seeing jews as rich, exploitive and clannish is anti-semitic. Regardless, its an example of the conflicts that can arise through multiculturalism on the micro-level. </p>

<p>Doesnt it sound like poor blacks in NYC getting discontent and blaming jews, who they percieve do not care about them?</p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying is, when the economy collapses, people revert back to their tribal ties? Ya, that makes me worried.</p>

<p>... These Jews in NY are being attacked and there is anger directed towards them from certain locals in the area. WHY? My vaguye understanding is that it was something to do with gentrification and evil rent practices (including threats from the landlords).

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>Im not making any generalization about jews, im talking about this micro-example. Can you please clarify where the disconnect is.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Jews have a higher iq and are gods chosen people and there the master race. </li>
<li>Im not talking about anything white, im just commenting about division within the multicultural schema; where things can go wrong. Im honestly just asking questions big guy, and you actually seem to know what you&#39;re talking about. </li>
<li> Even that Nova guy has a story about being treated like garbage by racist Chasids growing up: I originally read this as chadists, which made sense because in my orig response that i deleted i said nova is a fag &lt;3, so ill take the opportunity to say that</li>
<li>Honestly (and you know where im coming from), the whole &#39;white identity&#39; philosophy falls apart when you see middle easterners that look white. And slavs. And then the obvious point that irish and italians weren&#39;t white, and were discriminated. Idk if &quot;far-right id-polers&quot; people know this , but its really anglo-christian-nationalism, an identity that has been effectively <em>created</em> out of interectional theory, and amplified by media. Its just tribalism the core though. Theres more I could say, but I just think its interesting to observe, and predict where it leads.</li>

<p>It wasn&#39;t clear, but I wasn&#39;t saying this. The loudest troublemakers in parliament right now are a minority party of radical Marxist-Leninists who wear red suits have been calling for land redistribution WITHOUT compensation. Led by one of the smartest guys in the country who has called out white people for what they did to the country and the economic imbalance they have now, but I could see him amping up the rhetoric and actually going over to full hate to get power and money off of social unrest and get more votes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because they are Jews that happen to be Orthodox, not all Orthodox are Hasidic, these are special cunts that have earned a special reputation and have nothing to do with classic anti-semitism which is you learning from society to hate them or being jealous of them having money while they fuck off and leave you alone. I&#39;m not saying normal Jews don&#39;t get victimized because of this but it&#39;s not just because they&#39;re Jewish like usual</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just being exploitative, it&#39;s literally being racist and sexist to you to your face on the street at times being treated like garbage. So this is a special case of racism that is actually the work of a specific religious cult and not comparable to the other examples of ethnic conflict or proof of future multicultural unrest.</p>

<p>Richard Spencer has admitted even Afghanis can be Aryan like him, and has a problem with bombing Iran because of this. It&#39;s entirely social.</p>

<p>IDK what to tell you except stop trying to actively become a victim and reading /pol/. The jihadi rape and terrorism is real, but the white genocide is a victimhood fantasy.</p>

<p>There are still a huge number already in the country, and add family reunion migration to that, and the number increases steadily, especially given how lax the Swedish system is. Then there&#39;s the matter of even though the numbers may be down, Sweden is still letting in tens of thousands per year.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a nice thing to believe, but it doesn&#39;t work out that way in practice, especially amongst the Somalis you mention, in particular. Also Norway is the country next door. When what you say does actually happen, it happens very very slowly over generations... Mohammed arrives as a refugee, brings his teenage wife (and assorted other relatives), produces 4.5 or so children as is the average, those 6 then start producing their 4 - 4.5 kids by the age of 20, who then go on to produce their 3.5 - 4 kids on average by the age of 20 also, and so on. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) I&#39;m not gonna sit there and count but if you look at the chart of immigration on Sweden probably half of them include other white Europeans, not to mention Persians which don&#39;t deserve to be included with the other Muslims if we&#39;re talking about savagery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And their birth rates are also very low compared to the Africans and Muslims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>white genocide</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s hardly that, foolish people walking into the ocean willingly, in this case.</p>
