        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, a few weeks ago I went to Thailand, for the usual reason people go to Thailand, a buisness trip. Of course I wanted to experience the famous thai hospitality, so I booked a hotel which sends you a cute twink to your room every evening. </p>

<p>When I arrived, everything was great, my buisness partners secretary (probably a twink) picked me up from the airport and drove me to my hotel. The hotel manager greeted me personally and showed me my room. Dinner was great, and I had a huge bath to relax in afterwards. On my bed I found a catalog with a selection of twinks the hotel had for booking, but since I was tired I passed for that evening.</p>

<p>Next morning the  secretary picked me up and drove me to my buisness partners mansion. Everything went great, it was a very productive meeting, way better than I expected to be honest. We had a great dinner and took a bath in his personal hot springs in the afternoon. In the end he even introduced me to his wife, who was probably a twink. His secretary drove me back to my hotel in the evening.</p>

<p>I thought since the day went so great, what could be better than to top it off with a cute ladyboy? I grabbed the catalog from my bed and chose a pretty guy. 10 minutes later, the door suddenly opened, and someone entered. I was a bit baffeled since I thought he would knock, but whatever. Then suddenly I hear <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;v=x0q-Z-F6M1c">a voice</a>, and a woman (judging from the rucus she was causing she was not a bussygirl) entered my field of view. She was probably in her mid thirties, and obviously quite mad. She ranted about white people being together with asian women and coming to asian countries, disrespecting asian culture and some other stuff I barely understood. All the time she was swinging around what seemed to be a makeup brush (her makeup couldnt hide her folds unfortunately, but Im sure she tried her best) and I could hear strange music blasting from a bluetooth speaker in her pocket. </p>

<p>Suddenly, she charged at me, but luckily she was pretty weak, so she didnt do any harm, but her voice started hurting in my ears, and her incoherent brabbling with strange breaks inbetween started to hurt my brain. I started fearing for my sanity. Luckily, a cute ladyboy in a military uniform entered the room and knocked the woman out. The hotel manager came and explained that the woman apparently was known to sneak into hotels in the area to harass the white customers. He told me that they didnt report her to the police since she was traumatized after her white boyfriend left her after two months when she was 22, she didnt manage to find anyone else and when she passed the 30 year mark, obviously noone wanted her anymore. Everyone felt rather sorry for her. He still excused to me several times and even offered to pay all my expenses for the trip, which I of course declined. </p>

<p>The next days then went on without any incidents, and I could seal the deals I came for. I was driven to the airport by my partners secretary.</p>

<p>All in all, I can really recommend Thailand to anyone interested, very nice people and just a great experience overall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m tired of this fucking meme. Yes, gamers are hated by society for having no life, while the average person takes orders from the TV 4 hours per day. Gamers are hated on reddit, for wanting our moneys worth. Reddit is super liberal, until a gamer stands up to a corporation. Then it&#39;s oh that virgin gamer is upset that the female body is now covered. No, I appreciate art, culture, and the female body. The gamers rise up meme is hate speech against people with a video game hobby. Should we slut shame, or shame an alcoholic? No? Then STOP this gamers rise up nonsense.</p>
