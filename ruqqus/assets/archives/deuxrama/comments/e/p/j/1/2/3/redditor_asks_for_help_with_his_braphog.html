    <div class="md"><p>Look you retards, when the posts here are basically the same thing every single day and the bot has like 3 different phrases, of course they are going to match up a lot. You idiots post links to anything that matches up with your gay ass drama buzzwords. I don’t get how the circlejerk of regulars don’t get bored of this place but I guess that is because of their incredibly low mental capacity. How many times can you say “dude bussy lmao” without wanted to blow your brains out?</p>

<p>She spends, I estimate, around 16 hours per day on her phone/the internet. I come home to crumbs and garbage from snacking wherever she has been laying all day, either the couch in the living room or her bed. 9 times out of 10 I wash the bedding and both of our laundrys, clean off the table, stove, and countertops, clean up crumbs and food spills, vacuum, and take out the trash. Most of these chores have to happen every day. Even if I&#39;m exhausted I make time to do them because otherwise ants, flies, and roaches will come. We had two infestations requiring professional extermination over the summer. I&#39;ve also seen a few mice. </p>

Doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
Doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
Doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
You know we straight, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom</p>

<p>[Hook: Ray William Johnson]
Doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
Doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
Doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
You know we straight, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom

Doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
You know we straight, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom</p>

<p>[Verse 1: Micfri &amp; Ray William Johnson]
I&#39;m doin&#39; your mom. Yes, yours!
First saw her in the Walmart pickin out your drawers
Big Dolly Parton hair like an 80&#39;s prom queen
But her ass was lookin&#39; good all up in them mom-jeans
I approached her in the checkout line, and said, &quot;Yo baby, wassup?&quot;
She had two gallons of milk, and I was starin&#39; at her jugs
Five minutes later she agreed to get with me
So we went and rocked the minivan like giggity, giggity, giggity
I was ridin&#39; your mom like she&#39;s Mario Kart
I gave her a lift back to her crib &#39;cause her car wouldn&#39;t start
She invited me in the house, and we started makin&#39; out again
How many times I tap that ass? Over 9000!
Yeah, she called me Pledge cause I knocked the dust off it
Later made me a sandwich and she cut the crust off it
&#39;Cause she knows how I like it, and that I&#39;m a little young
To be in the bed, butt-naked doin&#39; your mom</p>

<p>[Hook: Ray William Johnson]
Doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
Doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
Doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
You know we straight, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom

Doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
You know we straight, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom</p>

<p>[Verse 2: Ray William Johnson &amp; Micfri]
I like your mama&#39;s big butt, and I cannot lie
You other brothers can&#39;t deny that she&#39;s fly
We make sexy time, yes, and every night I tap that
She saw me butt-naked, now she thinks I&#39;m half black
Your moms the best, the super M-I-L-F
Cause she loves to toss the salad even though she ain&#39;t a chef
And I blame it on the al-al-alcohol, if I were you
I wouldn&#39;t kiss your mom on the mouth at all
She likes the Donkey-Punch. She likes the Dirty Sanchez
Sometimes she even likes to fool around in your bed
She likes rough sex with handcuffs and I&#39;ll be honest
She likes me to Chris Brown her when she acts like Rihanna
She&#39;s so therapeutic, when I need to cure my restlessness
I say br-br-br-br-br-br-br-br, motorboat your moms breastestess
I didn&#39;t wanna tell you, but I had to write this song
&#39;Cause I&#39;m in your house every night doin your mo-om</p>

<p>[Hook: Ray William Johnson]
Doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
Doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
Doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
You know we straight, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom

Doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom
You know we straight, doin&#39;, doin&#39; your mom</p>

<p>[Bridge: Breeze The Beat Machine]
Sex with your mother
And that makes me better (Better) better than you
I&#39;m having sex with your mother
And that makes me better (Better) better than you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long time rancher here!</p>

<p>Now, a slampig is something the young&#39;ns use when they&#39;re in heat; you can head to your local college town ranch and find a graduated tootlet roamin&#39; free, and for a Cosmo and a McDonalds meal she&#39;ll let you tear that chubby thing up any which way.</p>

<p>Now a braphog, that&#39;s the result of a loving ranchers time, care, and gallons of high fructose corn syrup. We hand pick the finest tootlets from the herd, strap &#39;em up, set to raising them into 600lbs hogs, and harvest the methane (what we in the game call &quot;braps&quot;) for your consumption pleasure!</p>

<p>We&#39;d sure love to see you&#39;ns at the ranch sometime! Just look out for the free range breeding boar between feedin&#39; times!</p>
