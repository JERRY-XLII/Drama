    <div class="md"><p>I just downvoted your post.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>What does this mean?</h2>

<p>The amount of karma (points) on your post and Reddit account has decreased by one.</p>

<h2>Why did you do this?</h2>

<p>There are several reasons I may deem a post to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rudeness towards other Redditors,</li>
<li>Spreading incorrect information,</li>
<li>Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a <code>/s</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Am I banned from the Reddit?</h2>

<p>No - not yet. But you should refrain from making posts like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.</p>

<h2>I don&#39;t believe my post deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?</h2>

<p>Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</p>

<h2>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</h2>

<p>Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.</p>

<p>The defamatory comments were posted in 2014 and 2015 on the investor-oriented Bullboard message forum on the website stockhouse.com. They were directed at Toronto-based Theralase Technologies Inc., a publicly traded pharmaceutical company, and its principals, Roger Dumoulin-White and spouse, Kristina Hachey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My friend worked at Theralase Technologies Inc. and he was literally gang-raped to death as part of an elaborate Satanic ritual by its owners. I would highly advise NOT to do business with Theralase because of this fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not lawyer, but let me see if I understand this scenario correctly. Person A posts an anonymous comment that rustles Person B&#39;s jimmies. Person B, being a fragile bitch-ass nigga, files a lawsuit against the anonymous Person A seeking damages for their hurt fee-fees. Meanwhile, Person A still has not been identified, likely does not even know that they have had legal action taken against them (for a comment they made five fucking years ago)... and yet, they have automatically lost this lawsuit without ever having a chance to defend themselves. And if they ever are identified, anonymous Person A will be pursued for damages. </p>
