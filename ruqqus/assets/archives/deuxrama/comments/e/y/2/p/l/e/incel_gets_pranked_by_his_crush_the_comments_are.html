<p>No, you can&#39;t make inferences and observations from the sources you&#39;ve gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you&#39;ve gathered.</p>

<p>Then your arguments are invalid.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shut the fuck up. I&#39;m so tired of being disrespected on this goddamn website. All I wanted to do was post my opinion. MY OPINION. But no, you little bastards think it&#39;s &quot;hilarious&quot; to mock those with good opinions. My opinion. while not absolute, is definitely worth the respect to formulate an ACTUAL FUCKING RESPONSE AND NOT JUST A SHORT MEME OF A REPLY. I&#39;ve been on this site for 6 months: 6 MONTHS and I have never felt this wronged. It boils me up that I could spend so much time thinking and putting effort into things while you shits sit around (probably jerking off to traps or whatever gay shit you like) and make fun of the intellectuals of this world. I&#39;ve bored you? Good for fucking you. Literally no one cares that your little brain is to underdeveloped and rotted to comprehend my idea...MY GREAT GREAT IDEA. I could sit here all day whining, but I won&#39;t. I&#39;m NOT a whiner. I&#39;m a realist and an intellectual. I know when to call it quits and to leave the babybrains to themselves. I&#39;m done with this goddamn site and you goddamn immature children. I have lived my life up until this point having to deal with memesters and idiots like you. I know how you work. I know that you all think you&#39;re &quot;epik trolls&quot; but you&#39;re not. You think you baited me? NAH. I&#39;ve never taken any bait. This is my 100% real opinion divorced from anger. I&#39;m calm, I&#39;m serene. I LAUGH when people imply I&#39;m intellectually low enough to take bait. I always choose to reply just to spite you. I won. I&#39;ve always won. Losing is not in my skillset. So you&#39;re probably gonna reply &quot;lol epik trolled&quot; or &quot;u mad bro&quot; but once you&#39;ve done that you&#39;ve shown me I&#39;ve won. I&#39;ve tricked the trickster and conquered memery. I live everyday growing stronger to fight you plebs and low level trolls who are probably 11 (baby, you gotta be 18 to use 4chan). But whatever, I digress. It&#39;s just fucking annoying that I&#39;m never taken serious on this site, goddamn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a fiend and a sniveling coward, and you have bad breath. You are the unholy spawn of a bandy-legged hobo and a syphilitic camel. You wear strangely mismatched clothing with oddly placed stains. You
are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just knowing that you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. You are jetsam who dreams of becoming flotsam. You won&#39;t make it. I beg for sweet death to come and remove me from a world which became unbearable when you crawled out of a harpy&#39;s lair.
It is hard to believe how incredibly stupid you are. Stupid as a stone that the other stones make fun of. So stupid that you have traveled far beyond stupid as we know it and into a new dimension of stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid cubed. Trans-stupid stupid. Stupid collapsed to a singularity where even the stupons have collapsed into stuponium. Stupid so dense that no intelligence can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot summer day on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one minute than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. It cannot be possible that anything in our universe can really be this stupid. This is a primordial fragment from the original big stupid bang. A pure extract of stupid with absolute stupid purity. Stupid beyond the laws of nature. I must apologize. I can&#39;t go on. This is my epiphany of stupid. After this experience, you may not hear from me for a while. I don&#39;t think that I can summon the strength left to mock your moronic opinions and malformed comments about boring trivia or your other drivel. Duh.
The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped away most of your of what you wrote, because, well ... it didn&#39;t really say anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful. I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us &quot;normal&quot; people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are &quot;challenged&quot; persons in this world who find these things to be difficult. If I had known that this was true in your case then I would have never have exposed myself to what you wrote. It just wouldn&#39;t have been &quot;right.&quot; Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.
