    <div class="md"><p>The mooncricket police chief started carrying on and whining about racism in the department, so he was fired(but mr fag couldn&#39;t get away with that so he demoted him). The chief recorded a cop saying he couldn&#39;t wait for white people to be in charge, and that the donors would have Pete fire the chief which he did. The racist cop in question didn&#39;t get touched. So now the police have spent several years fighting to prevent that tape which would presumably exonerate them from being released to the public. He couldn&#39;t be mayor of a town of 8000 people without some scandal involving extreme corruption and racism.</p>

<p>so are u trynna get corporate money out of politics or no?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>no lol</p>

<p>Aside from openly admitting he loves corporate money, he was also a consultant at a firm involved with fixing the prices of bread in Canada. Then telling black voters I don&#39;t want your vote, blaming the problem of the black community being so shitty and poor entirely on being unmotivated and not having good role models(as if poor white people don&#39;t also have poor kids), inviting black community leaders/clergy to pretend to listen to what they want and then using the fact that they showed up to lie about them endorsing him for president lmao. And then he just keeps inserting obvious tokens on all his pictures while making it clear he doesn&#39;t give a fuck about black people every time he speaks in public.</p>
