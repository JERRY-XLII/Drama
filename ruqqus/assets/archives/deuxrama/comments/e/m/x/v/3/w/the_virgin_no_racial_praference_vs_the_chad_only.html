    <div class="md"><p>Howdy, my name is Rawhide Kobayashi. I&#39;m a 27 year old Japanese Japamerican (western culture fan for you foreigners). I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle&#39;s hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This man is a pedophile who’s used the names u/YameteOniichanItai(deleted after posting Lolicon porn), u/BigTiddyAnimeWaifu(deleted after posting Lolicon porn), u/WatermelonMcNuggets(suspended for admitting he liked masturbating to underage girls on Instagram), u/EasternMaybe(inactive), u/Shortcakespecial, u/LolIsDaiSukI(suspended),u/CorgieOwner711(suspended), u/strawberryspoongecake(suspended for possibly posting child porn) u/accidentialmagic , u/LargeNosedMan and<a href="/u/10pep">/u/10pep</a>(suspended after posting an underage girl to r/Jizzedtothis). This man is a sick fuck. He also was banned for describing wanting to rape a 10 year old girl as part of a “big brother/little sister” rape fantasy of his. Recently he has taken to harassing people on Reddit who call him out as well as doubling down on why his pedophilia and mild hebephilia should be viewed as a legitimate orientation and anyone who doesn’t agree with him is automatically a bigot or a troll or an alt. Also u/LGLL26 and u/CoupeMaster might be one of his alts as well and u/PRs4MyWaifu is a fake alt he gave. He’s expressed interest in having “cute half Asian daughters but no boys because they have mental problems” which might be a front for saying he wants daughters so he can live out his fantasy of raping “real life lolis” as he doesn’t have much interest in boys though he did say he likes “twink” underage boys and finds their bodies very attractive. This person has also admitted to keeping a photo album full of pictures of children that he masturbates too and has mentioned using sunglasses to hide the fact that he enjoys leering at little girls. He’s also expressed his interest in traveling to Asian countries where trafficking underage children is very common. If you actually know this man and you have children it is ill advised to continue associating with him. Another development is that he’s recently expressed his interest in adopting a little girl to “raise and adore” as he put it, I don’t think I have to tell you what he really intends. There’s also a good chance he may have fled his home country of Hungary and gone to Switzerland or Sweden to escape a rape charge involving an underage girl, not a “legal but underage” girl but one who was too young. Take the last few parts with a grain of salt as this guy routinely lies about where he is from and has lied about his ethnicity as well. He also routinely lies about his health and weight as well. This isn’t me go after someone for thought crimes, he fully intends to offend one day if he hasn’t already by this point.</p>

<p>There’s also a little link here to a story he wanted to write <a href="https://snew.notabug.io/r/anime/comments/b6ieik/do_you_think_this_light_novel_idea_could/">https://snew.notabug.io/r/anime/comments/b6ieik/do_you_think_this_light_novel_idea_could/</a></p>

<p>Along with the post he made about wanting to adopt a little girl(will edit if he deletes but I have the screenshot) <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b5d6rz/it_should_be_legal_for_fit_single_men_in_their/">https://old.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b5d6rz/it_should_be_legal_for_fit_single_men_in_their/</a></p>

<p>He has biastophilic urges as well <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/p6YRSLp">https://m.imgur.com/a/p6YRSLp</a></p>

<p>And here he is once again proving he wants to rape whatever unfortunate child he adopts <a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/T5p3Ug8">https://m.imgur.com/a/T5p3Ug8</a></p>
