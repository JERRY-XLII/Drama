    <div class="md"><p>Every straight man wants to fuck another mans daughter, but no man actually wants his daughter to get fucked, its more something that men just accept because you have to expect to go through what your wife&#39;s father had to endure, if you plan on having children. There are however the rare cases of men who do what I referred to in my mind as &quot;Closing The Loop&quot;. Around that time when I was talking to my friends about this, about a week after the school scheduled for us to be given an inspirational speech by some rich white guy, basically all we heard were the same BS normie rhetoric which is just a denial of reality, you know like &quot;Just be yourself and work hard&quot;, statements that outright deny reality and the inherent advantages, genetic or otherwise, that differentiate everyone. One thing in particular that he said proved to me how lucky this guy was, he had multiple children and they were all boys, he said that he even kept trying to have a daughter but he only got sons, one of his sons even went on to become a millionaire. Seriously how fucking lucky is that, all I could think while sitting in that class, is that this lucky bastard closed the loop, without even trying. He got to fuck the shit out of the daughters of many men, but he will never be forced to live through the awkward phase of having to let an extension of yourself be sexually dominated by another man, he&#39;ll never have to face the awkwardly repulsive thoughts that a lot of fathers probably have to face, like the fact that in these times your daughter is likely going to be taking it in the ass, and will probably have all sought&#39;s of sick shit done to her. At the end of the day there are only two ways to close the loop, to only have sons by luck, or don&#39;t have any children at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t have a life where your boyfriend is your only friend, you&#39;re just putting more pressure on the relationship and sorry but, relationships end, and when that one does as most of them do, you now have no friends.</p>

<p>i&#39;m being dead serious by the way because i&#39;ve been in this same position where my ex gf was my literal only social life, and of course it ended like most relationships do, and then i had to struggle to not be completely isolated and actually get friends.</p>

<p>friendships are less fragile than relationships and won&#39;t often just end forever too, you can rely on them more, they are a nice buffer. also in my experience having an SO who is your only social outlet makes you both clingy as fuck and it&#39;s just not good for the relationship either, get some fucking friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that sucks, is there any individual people you like, that you know from work or anywhere? you can just suggest to them you hang out sometime and drink or whatever and you&#39;ll end up meeting their friends (who are logically going to be similar to the person you get along with ) and then you just sort of get assimilated into their group.</p>

<p>after me and my ex broke up we kept in touch and stuff, she also managed to get a social life by hanging out with a few girls from her work she liked, met more people through them, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many at work aren’t really seeking for friendships among colleagues. They were a few I wanted to be friends with but like I said in my video, they were just really good and at being fake nice. There’s no loyalty whatsoever. They would just hang out with anyone who’s useful to them. So, over time I also learned to keep my own distance.</p>

<p>I found someone really nice but not long ago, I brought about LGBT. I didn’t talk about anything controversial really. Just that we came across a gay couple and their face turned really cold and distant. Which made me wonder if they were homophobic. </p>

<p>I just want nice loyal honest people who like me for who I am and vice versa. Apparently, that’s just too much to ask.</p>

<p>In the past, I had a couple of close friends and a best friend at all times. But I’ve been backstabbed not once. Not twice. But three times. </p>

<p>It’s either that or friends dropped me like a hot potato once they got their romantic partner. Some went even as far as telling me that they loved me and crossing the lines of romantic and platonic but they always left me anyway. </p>

<p>My resolution was to merge friendship and romantic relationship because that seems to be the only way that I could make people stay. </p>

<p>You see. This world is based on finding a mate and starting a family. Do you think your friends with kids would choose you over their spouse and children? </p>

<p>I’m willing to love people platonically but deeply but most people don’t function like that.</p>

<p>Life is fucking hard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And also I am guessing friends to you are someone you are close to. But to me it’s people that I would love like my own family. That’s why I don’t use friends lightly to describe someone. Even in the chat, most are single and looking for someone to love and to be loved but only romantically. It feels like the kind of love I want to give is the kind that people want or need.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>in alot of ways romantic partners are closer to you but also distant. like being straight, my SO is always going to be a girl, my super close male friends, when i have them, &quot;get&quot;  me better, men and women are different. there is also less judgement, you can&#39;t ever be 100% brutally honest with an SO but you can be more honest with a close friends about stuff.</p>

<p>i tend to value close friends of my own gender pretty damn highly, possibly more highly than romantic relationships because romantic relationships end, when they go bad, they dissolve forever. they are a &quot;it&#39;s only me forever or we are done&quot; kinda thing whereas friends don&#39;t literally demand you have one friend and then cancel the entire friendship over something, like that happens but not as often as relationships end.</p>

<p>you mentioned friends confessing love to you and shit and like....gonna be honest, you will never be as good friends with the opposite gender as you will with your own, first of all, half the &quot;friendships&quot; with opposite gender people (this is especially true for women) will be based on ulterior motives to begin with, and secondly, men and women are different, men can never &quot;get&quot; you as much as another foid, that&#39;s a fucking fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sweaty, so heteronormative.</p>

<p>I’ve dated more women and transmen than men, you know...</p>

<p>I swing all the ways. I follow love instead of genitals. I think that’s why things get super complicated. I’m like pretty asexual. I don’t have the urge to bone people, especially random people I barley know.</p>

<p>Yeah, there are definitely things the opposite sex cannot relate to but that’s mainly limited to biological things like guys don’t period poops and stuff. I can definitely go on with life without discussing about it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>and i disagree, the differences between men and women go beyond literally physical flesh shit, men and women are different psychologically, we are treated different by society and have different expectations placed upon us, and are raised different based on social norms, and our brains are literally different. i do not have the same upbringing as the typical foid and i will not understand their life experiences and they will not understand mine, not on average.</p>

<p>there are far more differences than just &quot;i shit while on period&quot; or morning boners or some shit. anyway the point i made isn&#39;t that complicated, just that being good close friends with women is going to be better than friends with dudes who more often than not are only even friends with foids to try to fuck them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm I think we are just very different people. I like that I can learn from my romantic partner. Not that I was ever a man hater despite my feminist LARP on here. It made me want to understand what men feel and go through in life more. Another layer of it is race. Dating outside my race has been a real eye opener. I’ve learned the positives and the negatives that they go through. It turned me into a more open minded and empathetic person. </p>

<p>This is one of things that led me to places like here where it’s male majority. Like I said even though I LARP all day as super SJW feminist type. You would find that I’m one of the few women who try to look things from a male’s perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i mean i never said men and women should be segregated or that i&#39;m incapable of relating to a foid but like, it&#39;s just a fact that it&#39;s easier for me to closely bond to a male since we are more likely to share similar psychology, life experiences, societal expectations, etc etc, than i will ever share with a foid.</p>

<p>my ex was one of 4 people i&#39;ve been closest too in my entire life, and she was a foid, but she is still slightly edged out by several best male friends, and uhh, she&#39;s gone now forever because when relationships end they end, but friendships don&#39;t end like that ( as often), so yeah.</p>

<p>take from all that what you will.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t. Like most things in my life, it came effortlessly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s complicated.</p>

<p>I speak for all the good people of deux when I say HiL is a truly great person and an even better friend. However, I speak for all the good people of deux when I say it is unsporting and unprofessional to openly question the wisdom and discernment of our superiors. It is unfortunate a cheap wine dependency exposed her uncontrollable jealousy of me for all to see.</p>

<p>unless im imagining it and looking to closely the g in guy at 0:31 seemed pretty nasal like a vietnamese person, and just some of the general pronunciation makes me guess that but realistically there&#39;s not any difference so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happened to my accent is a very complicated thing. I grew up watching American, Chinese, Korean and Japanese shows but I studied under (pause) britbong teachers. My family is Asian and that’s why I have an Asian accent too.</p>

<p>My accent changes depending on the person I am currently speaking to but it becomes a jumbled mess when I’m alone because there’s no accent around me to latch onto and my accent just switches randomly on its own. I have no control over it. I normally start to sound very British when I’m angry.</p>
