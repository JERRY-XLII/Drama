<h1>About This Product</h1>

<p>In this era, the word &quot;gay&quot; appears more and more in TV and movies. Compared
with the past, the whole society seems to be more inclusive for the
homosexuals. However, looking around, there are not so many homosexuals who
are willing to confess their gay identity and come out to their families. Too
many homosexuals don&#39;t seem to be accepted as we imagined. This lets us start
asking ourselves, do we really understand them? How many difficulties in their
lives are often overlooked by us? This game may help you to understand more
about the homosexual group and to understand the problems and obstacles they
encounter.<br/>
The game allows players to experience the first-person perspective to a gay
boy&#39;s life. As a protagonist, you have discovered from childhood that you
don&#39;t like girls, and for the first time in adolescence, you start to fall in
love with boys. Then you fled from the small county to the big city, while
feeling that the gay community is accepted by more people, but when you return
home, you still see the eyes that your loved ones don&#39;t understand. As you go
deep into the open circle of homosexual relationships, marriage system,
surrogacy, undisclosed homosexuality, fraudulent marriage, etc. You see too
much content beyond your moral bottom line. Accepting or resisting makes you
feel confused. The sense of identity with the self is also changing over time.
In the end, will you choose to receive treatment, swindle to avoid stress, or
spend a lifetime with someone you love? The answer to this question may only
be waiting for you to find it in the game.  </p>

<p>FeatureÔºö<br/>
‚ÄúBeautiful picture and music‚Äù: The whole game screen is in the form of hand-
painted, with the music of famous artists, so that the whole game is very
comfortable to play.<br/>
&quot;The perfect combination of games and science&quot;: There are a lot of knowledge
about homosexuality in the game, so that everyone can deepen their
understanding of the gay community while they are entertaining.<br/>
&quot;Big branch line&quot;: Many branch plots, different choices will lead to
unexpected endings~<br/>
&quot;Very real story&quot;: The setting of the game story is very similar to the real
situation in the real society.<br/>
&quot;Stimulus game system&quot;: There will be a quick quiz game in the face of the
dispute scene in the game. If you choose the wrong one, you may enter the
ending that you do not expect to enter, which is very exciting and thrilling.</p>
