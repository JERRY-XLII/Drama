    <div class="md"><p>Obviously it&#39;s considered unacceptable to speak ill of the dead everywhere you go, so these guys did that and took it to a whole new level. Probably part of the reason why Chiraq has so much murder, because they love to do this shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>T. Roy ain&#39;t get shot inside his head but he ain&#39;t make it though</p>
</blockquote>

<p>what a weak bitch to not get shot in the head and still die</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They got so many dead niggas, bitch, I don&#39;t know who to smoke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the opps(opposition) get caught lackin(in a moment of vulnerability), one smokes on a pack(weed, but figurative in this case) and the pack is the dead gentlemen he dances on the grave of and relishes in their death publicly. Such as Chief Keef famously proclaiming that he was smoking on a Tooka pack, Tooka being one of the dead homies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know who to smoke, but I&#39;ll take Lil Boo to go
I can see him through the smoke (Ayy, ayy)
Caught his ass comin&#39; out the crib, shot him through the door</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am relishing in the fact that this man was murdered in his in home as he exited his front door</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tweakin&#39; off the mids, I think Lil Steve comin&#39; through the floor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to also disrespect this man Lil Steve by making a joke about hallucinating and seeing his ghost rise through the floor</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He got caught in traffic, Waldo ain&#39;t get to finish his status
He on the internet laughin&#39;, cappin&#39;, then got caught without it
Fuck your homie, he dead, you heard what I said</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to point out the irony of being murdered in the midst of speaking ill of the dead on social media, and revel in it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fuck Sheroid, fuck Odee, fuck D-Thang, and fuck Tire Head</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All dead</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Baldy got smoked by a tree, run up on him with the stick and smoked him like a leaf</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dead</p>

<blockquote>
<p>J Money got it the worst of me, that&#39;s how it&#39;s &#39;posed to be
It&#39;s a lot of niggas that I&#39;m not even gon&#39; mention but they where they &#39;posed to be, uh
Niggas be thinkin&#39; they killers, uh, you look like a ghost to me, uh
Boy, I been smokin&#39; your homie, uh, this shit chokin&#39; me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s great that J money was shot in the head, and believe me, I am enjoying the deaths of all your friends</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mentioning Scrapp ain&#39;t gon&#39; get you shit but a brand new grave slab
We do it for Scrapp, we done fucked around and made 600 change blocks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am speaking ill of the dead of over a dozen people in this song, but I advise you that you should not speak ill of my deceased friends and family, or I will be forced to shoot you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m fresh off a hit, might switch up the clothes, but I got the same Glock
You know what it is, we comin&#39; for more, might shoot up the same block</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I murder so much I may just go home, change my clothes, and immediately go out and murder a 2nd person</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These niggas mentionin&#39; Tooka, I&#39;ll fuck around, send you to meet him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you speak ill of the dead homie Tooka, I will kill you</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uh, I don&#39;t got my Glock, when I see an opp, on bro, I&#39;ma beat &#39;em</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t need a firearm to commit acts of violence against my enemies</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uh, I&#39;m smokin&#39; Lil Steve can&#39;t breath, I&#39;m thinkin&#39; it&#39;s over</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m enjoying the death of Lil Steve excessively to the point where it might kill me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish I was right there when Lil Boo got slumped, I would&#39;ve ran his shit over</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am so happy about Lil Boo being murdered(his head ended up on the ground next to a tire, so they called him tirehead), that I wish I was there in order to run over his bleeding body or corpse and add to the humiliation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(Hold on, hold on, hold on, who this Steve on?)
Pass him to me, we&#39;ll just add him to the family tree
Smacked his ass with the back of the heat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My friend, please let me join you in celebrating the death of Lil Steve</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stello got hit from the back of the seat
Damn, the back of the seat?
He tried to get up from the back of the seat
They left his head in the back of the seat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find it highly amusing that his man was shot multiple times in his own car, he tried to get back up, and he was shot in the head</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have the option of moving, you probably aren&#39;t affected by this as it doesn&#39;t happen in your neighborhood. If you don&#39;t have the option of moving, then you might just end up joining a gang(people are born into them, almost nobody chooses to as an adult like corny ass 69 or Soulja Boy) due to social or economic conditions. And the biggest and most dangerous gang in the city is the police, who are known to do things like secretly disappear people and hold them in black sites like the CIA and interrogate them without a lawyer, so you don&#39;t have the option of just magically fixing your community by  running to mommy and daddy police like most white people in America think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brian Jacob Church, a protester known as one of the “Nato Three”, was held and questioned at Homan Square in 2012 following a police raid. Officers restrained Church for the better part of a day, <strong>denying him access to an attorney</strong>, before sending him to a nearby police station to be booked and charged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Unlike a precinct, no one taken to Homan Square is said to be booked. Witnesses, suspects or other Chicagoans who end up inside do not appear to have a public, searchable record entered into a database indicating where they are</strong>, as happens when someone is booked at a precinct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It’s sort of an open secret among attorneys that regularly make police station visits, this place – if you can’t find a client in the system, odds are they’re there,” said Chicago lawyer Julia Bartmes.</p>

<p><strong>She found out where he was after he was taken to the hospital with a head injury.</strong> “He said that the officers caused his head injuries in an interrogation room at Homan Square.** I had been looking for him for six to eight hours, and every department member I talked to said they had never heard of him<strong>,” Solowiej said. **“He sent me a phone pic of his head injuries because I had seen him in a police station right before he was transferred to Homan Square without any.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately Hunter the police exist for more than just being your mommy and daddy, and keeping niggers from stealing your unseasoned chicken.</p>
