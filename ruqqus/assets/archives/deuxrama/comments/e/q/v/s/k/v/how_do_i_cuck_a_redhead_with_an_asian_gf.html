        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The redhead: Scrawny weak, red hair, allergic to the sun, seems like a beta, probably happy that he&#39;s found a gf (who&#39;s actually just using him while looking for someone better)</p>

<p>The Asian girl: pocket sized, Asian, not smart at all for an Asian judging by her grades, cute though, devious since she deliberately tried to hide having a boyfriend from me, almost certainly into me</p>

<p>Me: Reasonably jacked with a strong back and thicc arms (good chin-up), no redhair, very intelligent and extremely humble with pretty good grades</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure she likes me, however she doesn&#39;t know I feel the same way about her. Now how do I get with her knowing she has a boyfriend? Imo she should just dump him and we could be a couple. Should I suggest that? Or something else?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys gotta quit participating or this fuckwit will never go away. Same thing with the yamete stalker accounts and casanova (although he kind of seems to be making an effort with the stupid memes). Just ignore it and don&#39;t make any comments or it will never die. Any attention at all and the schmucks will keep going.</p>

<p>As long as everyone has already commented here  I&#39;ll just add that Yamete, you are one of the biggest wholesale douchebags I have ever come across. Somehow you have managed to make being a pedo not even the most repulsive part of your personality. This girl and this guy are laughing at you. We&#39;re all laughing at you because you are so utterly abhorrent. You will never get this girl or any other. You couldn&#39;t even score with a little kid if you tried because they would instinctually be like &quot;omg what a disgusting creep, go away.&quot; You are a complete piece of shit and everyone you have ever had even a split second of contact with knows it.</p>
