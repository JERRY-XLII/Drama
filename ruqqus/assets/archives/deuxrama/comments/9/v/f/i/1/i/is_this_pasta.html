<p>Sunny’s writing is very layered. I’m sure you’ve picked up on this... but here me out. I once got Sunny on one level (old and new), then over time with my own growth, I’ve noticed more and more layers.</p>

<p>With my own observations, I’d say the later seasons are more rich with the layering. One example of an older Sunny episode that works on both the “pure humor, surface level” and the “deep but subtle, themes layer” is “Mac and Charlie Die”. Read Jospeh Campbell’s “The Heroes Journey” and then rewatch - a ton of new ideas and themes will become known to you.</p>

<p>Maybe try and rewatch some of the episodes you didn’t like and see if you can pick out any story/themes you missed before.</p>

<p>This show is creators’ is baby. They wouldn’t ever “get lazy” with it. Thinking this way creates a barrier between you and a true understanding of what the gang is trying to say. Sure, they have much more complicated lives and have to make sacrifices for the show... but it’s still here, cared for just as much as ever, and growing.</p>
