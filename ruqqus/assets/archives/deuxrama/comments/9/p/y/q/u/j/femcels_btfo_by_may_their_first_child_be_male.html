<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84kzwv/">WARNING: THIS IS A HORRIFIC BIRTH DEFECT THAT RESULTS IN DEATH.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84lb6h/">It&#39;s dehumanizing and unacceptable.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84lb6h/">However to be fair, if I ever have a family, I only want girls. I&#39;ve only ever wanted girls. I have no interest in raising sons. I want to raise high spirited, active, happy, rebellious, little girls who will grow into strong, confident, intelligent, radical, feminists.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84kd0c/">I don&#39;t want children anyway but IF I did and I don&#39;t even care if this sounds &quot;sexist&quot;, I&#39;d be horrified to have a boy. No matter how much you try to teach kids right from wrong, boys will learn from society and other men how to treat women. I&#39;ve read plenty of posts from feminist mothers how their sons turned out hating &quot;SJWs&quot; and &quot;feminazis&quot;. :/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84gxii/">It makes me so mad how totally socially acceptable it is to denigrate female children and strongly prefer male children. People start saying horrible things about female children before they&#39;re even born or conceived.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84gxii/">It also makes me so mad how people lose their minds when someone dares to say that they&#39;d prefer to have a daughter. Suddenly they&#39;re an evil man-hater and they have to hear all of these arguments about why it&#39;s so mean and it makes them a bad parent to have a preference</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84nbu7/">The funniest would be the reactions if a woman said &quot;may their first child be female&quot;.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84nbu7/">Half the dudes would be crying while rolling on the floor while the other half would be shouting angrily about feminazis and why does she hates men etc. And most women would be like &quot;why did you have to be so mean!&quot; or &quot;well I would be very glad to have a son, because i love men!&quot; and that would be the expected reaction for them.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9puqft/toast_to_male_children/e84nbu7/">It&#39;s so fun to see how fragile the male ego is and how normal most of them feel to inflict to women things that would made them burn constantly.</a></p>
