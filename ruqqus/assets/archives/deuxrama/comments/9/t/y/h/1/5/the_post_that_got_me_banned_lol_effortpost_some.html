<p>So allegdely a while back Mircy (our former mod) stopcopiesme (top mod of srd) Harrietpotter (a formerly famous troll) were all milked by a dedicated troll into falling in love with him and giving their dox to him. The troll 9<a href="/u/brokencfo">/u/brokencfo</a></p>

<p>was also the topmod of <a href="/r/incels">/r/incels</a> and is well known in powermod circles and is banned and blacklisted from many subs. It is also alleged stopcopiesme is a lesbian woman who poses as a man online to avoid sexism and harassment (interesting tid bit srdines might care about your top mod allegedly fucked a drama mod) This is also supposedly the reason she mods subs like the bluepill due to hurt from this betrayal.</p>

<p>Now a bit on the Q like figure he popped up on discord recently sending &quot;drops&quot; of info to users about meta drama.</p>

<p>Now for the reddit posts as sources</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/9txgyj/a_mysterious_discord_user_is_messaging/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/9txgyj/a_mysterious_discord_user_is_messaging/</a></p>

<p>and the discord post which isnt on reddit</p>

<p>Many years ago, there was a certain private group of up and coming reddit power mods who were catfished in an especially emotionally cruel way. Playing at an older man in a mentor or fatherly role, redditors u/Miranda
, u/stopscopies me (who is in fact female) and u/HarrietPotter all grew to love this fake persona very much. The stories are unclear is it was this persona or after he had revealed himself but Harriet actually fell in love with this man leading to an online relationship. As time went on, this older gentleman persona hinted at poor health, participating in the group less and less. By exchanging care packages he was able to collect hints at or complete doxxing info as well as milk their concern and grief as his roleplaying was leading up to his eventual staged disappearance and apparent death. When these three women found out it was a very hurtful, as you can well imagine. Harriet, the one who truly fell in love, is rumored to have picked up activity in subs she mods like r/thebluepill partially out of the hurt she experienced from falling in love with this catfishing redditor u/brokeCFO. Who incidentally was top moderator of r/incels. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIncelPill/comments/4vwg2o/incels_is_owned_by_brokecfo_an_alt_of_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIncelPill/comments/4vwg2o/incels_is_owned_by_brokecfo_an_alt_of_a/</a> Although not a proper incel himself, his probing for doxx and other shady dealings have earned him a very bad name in certain powermod circles to the point of being blacklisted.</p>
