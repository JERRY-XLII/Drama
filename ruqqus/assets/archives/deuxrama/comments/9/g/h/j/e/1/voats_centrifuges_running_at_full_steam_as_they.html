    <div class="md"><p>Some quotes:</p>

<p>Co-creator of voat acknowledges what we all know about Qultists - they&#39;re techno-illiterate boomer simpletons who can&#39;t even figure out an image board:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m just going to say that the back and forth I&#39;ve had tonight with subscribers of v/theawakening have been the most pleasurable I&#39;ve had on Voat. (Maybe I have low standards or you&#39;re just good people). </p>

<p>So here is my argument: <strong>They aren&#39;t super web savvy</strong> and reddit/voat layout is not that bad of a tool for what they are doing. <strong>They were directed to an image board. You all know that&#39;s a big jump coming from Reddit.</strong> The natural place is here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some others:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2722955/13860301">Their mods were a bunch of faggots who fucked them over from the second they stepped foot in here. I bet a lot of them are well intentioned people, but Reddit authoritarian mods will continue to do just that.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2722955/13862377">That being said, I feel dirty having interacted even the slightest bit with those degenerates. Gonna have to take a sandblast alcohol shower.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2722955/13861541">Please, for the fucking love of God, have some self respect. If you want to Larp about Q, fine, great. But don’t go signing up to have a boss tell you HOW to do it. Think for yourself. Neon basically tells all of you that he’ll do your thinking FOR you, and btw, buy my shit. He also phrases shit to take credit for the accomplishments of ANONYMOUS /pol/acks. Neon is a regular shitty nigger autist, not a weaponized autist.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2722955/13861541">If you MUST do your Q thing, have some damned dignity while you do it. The biggest thing about voat is, we may not be a bunch leaders, but we’re DEFINITELY not followers. A goat is a creature that will piss in its own face to spite you.</a></p>

<p>One boomer in particular bordering on too-good-to-be-true:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2722955/13866827">I belong to both groups, because I can&#39;t remember which 1 is the unsegregated town. I want to be in the subverse that is segregated! What&#39;s the use of moving from Reddit to voat if you don&#39;t assimilate? <strong>I am not tech savvy either! It&#39;s the age thing and the vision thing. That&#39;s why I went to Reddit</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2722955/13870766">Speaking as 1 of those technologically illiterate boomers! I feel so fucking used!</a></p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2722955/13871895">I&#39;ve worked since I was 16 years old, and <strong>I&#39;m now 61</strong>! I hate lazy.people who freeload ! And thankfully my kids have followed in my footsteps with their work ethics! Both of my daughter&#39;s are hard working capitalists and can&#39;t stand the libs!</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2722955/13875175">. I&#39;ve actually literally LOL at some of the posts and comments on voat. I Agree that political correctness is what has put us in this bind we&#39;re in now. I appreciate a lot of the humor on here! Shit we weren&#39;t allowed to say. <strong>When I&#39;m allowed to post, I&#39;ve collected some memes that would fit right in here.</strong> Thanks for taking the time to engage me with this conversation!</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unleash the memes Nana. </p>

<p>Too much to unpack here - I&#39;ll stop there.</p>
