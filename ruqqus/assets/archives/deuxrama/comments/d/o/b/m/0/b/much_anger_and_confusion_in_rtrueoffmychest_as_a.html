        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">7</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2019-10-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Longratter.html">Longratter</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A feminist made a thread on <a href="/r/OffMyChest">/r/OffMyChest</a> suggesting that men can get abused in a relationship, in the same way that a woman can be. The post ended up being deleted by mods, more on that later. The OP recreated the thread in <a href="/r/TrueOffMyChest">/r/TrueOffMyChest</a> here:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dnsj09/to_my_male_friends/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dnsj09/to_my_male_friends/</a></p>

<p>Some excerpts from the thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She has NO RIGHT to hit you under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE! It doesn’t matter if you were “looking at other girls” or whatever bullshit excuse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are women who lie about domestic violence and sexual assault. You have every right to defend yourself from such life-ruining slander. I hate that the feminist movement skips over this one. It’s uncomfortable to think about, and it doesn’t happen as much as people make it out to be. But it DOES happen, and to the victims of that, your experiences are valid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are all about equality for women, which should mean recognizing the equality in a woman’s ability to be an abuser. They are not exempt from this. You can be victims too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response to the post in OffMyChest, OP received the following response from one of the OffMyChest mods (unknown which one in particular):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OP, I’ve removed and locked this.</p>

<p>You overall sentiment is 100% correct, but you’ve got some unfortunate hateful slander in there yourself.
The feminist movement does not skip over the truth of false reports, but they are, factually, quite rare. (I’m also wondering why you’re even including it here - is your post suppose to support men or just talk trash about women?)
I further question your motives for posting based your strong desire to talk about women making false reports. Why is that your focus in a thread supposedly about female abusers? Is it at all possible to be on Reddit and not have seen one of the billion times that it’s brought up? It is, factually, talked about much more often than reality invites. You have literally no reason to 1. bring it up in this thread with your original chosen topic, nor 2. act like it isn’t talked about and needs more talk.</p>

<p>I’m not going to allow you to spread damaging untruths, and I am sad that you couldn’t support men without slandering the feminist movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And was banned from the subreddit. OP ended up creating the same post (I believe) in TrueOffMyChest, and got a much more positive reaction, however, due to continued harassment from OffMyChest mods (apparently, there&#39;s no factual evidence for this), OP ended up apologizing for their stance and deleting their account.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dnsj09/to_my_male_friends/f5g7nhs/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/dnsj09/to_my_male_friends/f5g7nhs/</a></p>

<p>Much confusion and anger in the comments as to what the fuck is going on, including many people realizing they&#39;ve been banned from offmychest without even knowing why, along with more people claiming that they were harassed by the offmychest mods.</p>

<p>The thread&#39;s original content got recreated, much to the rejoicing, and rising up of the free citizens of TrueOffMyChest: </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/do7hd0/not_going_to_be_silent_on_this_not_going_to_name/">https://np.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/do7hd0/not_going_to_be_silent_on_this_not_going_to_name/</a></p>

<p>And for a little bonus, here&#39;s a similar OffMyChest thread, nuked to oblivion:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dnv5rl/men_can_be_assaulted_too/">https://np.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dnv5rl/men_can_be_assaulted_too/</a></p>

<p>Sorry if the timeline is unclear, this is all very vague, and it&#39;s hard to piece together exactly what happened when, considering the original OffMyChest thread is gone.</p>
