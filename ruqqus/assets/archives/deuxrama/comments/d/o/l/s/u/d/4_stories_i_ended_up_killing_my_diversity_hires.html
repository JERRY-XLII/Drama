        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>accidental killings of diversity hires</strong></p>

<p>So, I was playing this train station management game <em>choo choo</em> called Overcrowd Commute ‚ÄòEm Up. It‚Äôs a really fun game if you like building and managing games like Oxygen Not Included.</p>

<p>In this game, you had to micro manage your staff in the past but they recently released a huge update on the staff AI. I was glad because I hated micro-ing the staff. I took a screenshot of my first employee lineup </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/CLKTjqP.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/CLKTjqP.jpg</a></p>

<p>You‚Äôll notice that they are all minorities and/or women. Wilson is really the star here. His experience has been maxed out and he can run a small station just by himself.</p>

<p>I forgot to take a screenshot when I hired two more employees. At that point, my station had 100% rating in reputation and I was getting tons of job applicants. I didn‚Äôt choose based on skills such as strength, stamina, speed and perception. I chose based on diversity. </p>

<p>So, I hired a black male employee named Ronald McDonald and an Indian female employee Singh (I forgot her first name). </p>

<p>They were both lacking in skill points but I hired them anyway because my station was doing so well. I wanted them to gain experience. You can bring over your employees to the next station. So, hiring new staff and making them level up while you are doing well is always a good strategy before you move on to a more difficult station. </p>

<p>Long story short, my station was massive with 3 levels and I forgot to add in skill points to their speed. First was McDonald. A rioter, probably a white SJW antifa, came into the station and when McDonald tried to arrest them, they punched him. Poor McDonald‚Äôs work ethics being way off the charts. He continued on working. The moment I realized he was hurt, I sent him back to the staff room to use the medicine cabinet. But his speed was too slow and he died like 5 steps away from the medicine cabinets. Technically, he exploded and his colleagues had to mop his remains. </p>

<p>I tried to move on and focus more on Singh. To avoid the same tragedy, I put her skill points into speed. Didn‚Äôt know that was going to be the downfall. While I was expanding my station to the north east side, I built a bridge. I, then, deleted it because I didn‚Äôt want passengers to be crossing and getting lost. Singh, who had the maxed out speed, had already crossed over to that side to pick up litter. Again, amazing work ethics. I didn‚Äôt know that and didn‚Äôt connect the new area to the main train station for some time due to shortage on money. Later,  Singh also exploded from not being able to get back to the other side to use the staff room.</p>

<p><strong>how my customers got set on fire by a duke</strong></p>

<p>So, I also played another game called Crossroads Inn. This RPG management game is great in concept. You run a medieval inn and I was looking forward to rent out rooms so customers could stay and sleep overnight. Before I even got anywhere to that point, I ran into a lot of problems.</p>

<p>First of all, this game is riddled with bugs and the staff in the game is really lazy. As soon as customers come in, my staff decides it‚Äôs a good time to smoke weed and stink up the room. When I scold them, their mood goes down. And they make sarcastic comments when I click on them like, ‚ÄúI live to serve üôÑ‚Äù.  </p>

<p>Another annoying part is the RPG storyline itself is not that interesting. This duke or prince or whatever has monopoly on wine and as a poor inn owner, I couldn‚Äôt afford his prices. So, I smuggled wine from bandits.</p>

<p>This duke would come over and try to find your smuggled wine. I didn‚Äôt know I could hide the barrels under the stairs and lock the doors. Didn‚Äôt even know I could lock the doors. What I did was used my charm to lie to his face and it worked 2 times. So, I thought everything was ok. </p>

<p>The duke came in undercover, ordered drinks and I served them. Soon after, he bought his men over and burned down my inn with my customers in it. My uncle and I survived but then, the game crashed. </p>

<p>It‚Äôs a really cool concept but it‚Äôs not worth it for now. </p>

<p><strong>Tried to get laid in a cyberpunk world and screwed myself</strong></p>

<p>I played yet another new game called Disco Elysium. It‚Äôs a RPG and people are already calling it revolutionary. It is unique for sure. The gameplay mechanics is something I‚Äôve never seen before. I don‚Äôt want to give too much away in case you want to experience it. It‚Äôs set in a futuristic, cyberpunk but also a bit medieval like in some areas world. It‚Äôs really beautiful. </p>

<p>You play as the detective who has lost his memory and as soon as I got him out of his hotel room and out the corridor, I tried to get him laid with this blonde chick. She said no and now I‚Äôm stuck doing a puzzle because she would not answer my knocks. üòì</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what I get for toxic masculinity. Be respectful to her when you play the game. The bartender also hates me and wouldn‚Äôt let me stay for the night anymore. My partner gave me some confiscated goods for me to pawn. I‚Äôm now having to resort to picking up bottles with a plastic bag and sell them. It‚Äôs bad out here. </p>

<p><strong>Neolithic godless thot</strong></p>

<p>So. I‚Äôm already very good at Dawn of Man. Another base building where you progress through different ages. Since I was already doing so well like I even built the Stonehenge, I got bored and decided to follow a random villager. </p>

<p>Little did I know, I ended up with a lazy thot. She kept going into different tents around the village. You know what that means üôÑ</p>

<p>When everyone was praying at the Stonehenge, she didn‚Äôt follow. She finally went outside of the village and shot down an animal. She didn‚Äôt even pick it up. She left it there and went on a break. She hadn‚Äôt done anything all day!!</p>

<p>She went to the river and began taking off her clothes in front of all the male villagers and then, she went into the tents some more. Following winter, a baby was born. Surprise! Surprise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Howdy, my name is Rawhide Kobayashi. I&#39;m a 27 year old Japanese Japamerican (western culture fan for you foreigners). I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle&#39;s hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be cool to have an actual Diversity Manager Simulator game. With a twist even: at first you think that your goal is to maximize diversity without killing the company, but when the company does go tits up you&#39;re just rehired by a bigger company with a larger salary based on your diversity clout, so...</p>
