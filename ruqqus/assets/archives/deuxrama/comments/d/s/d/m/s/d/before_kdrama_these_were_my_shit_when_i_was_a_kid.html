    <div class="md"><p>What’s so human about the Korean female lead eating lunch like a caveman and making stupid faces? 🙄</p>

<p>“Ooo look at me! I don’t eat like a normal human being with table manners! Ooo I’m so quirky. Look at me! I’m not like other girls!”</p>

<p>Give me a break 🙄 </p>

<p>Japanese female lead was way more realistic and relatable.  💅🏻 she was level headed, mature, graceful but also feisty when needed to be which eventually led the male lead to become mature as well. The whole point of the story was turning the spoiled rich bad boy into a good man.</p>

<p>Korean female lead acted like a 3 years old throwing a tantrum and how she managed to inspire the male lead, who was acting like a 2 years old, into a mature adult man is beyond me? 🙄</p>

<p>Makes no sense 💅🏻</p>

You, as a cis white male 🙄, probably don’t understand this but when we women are watching romantic stories, we are putting ourselves in the shoes of the female protagonist. She’s super annoying. How to fantasize, really? 🙄</p>

<p>Umm excuse me! Are you going to tell me Kim Woo Bin doesn’t have the hottest eyebrows and smile as well? 😡</p>

<p>The worst part about k-dramas is that they&#39;re designed for women so you&#39;re forced to identify with the female protagonist.  I could probably write an essay on this, or at least make a good sissy hypno video based on it.</p>

<p>OMG all those Chinese memes about how women who watch k-dramas are literally retarded were actually about you, weren&#39;t they? 🤣🤣🤣  Dude looks like a fucking robot after all the work they did on him.  He&#39;s not even human anymore.</p>

<p>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Imagine thinking Heirs was ever &quot;ruined&quot; when it was such shit from the beginning.  But thanks, you&#39;re really revealing a lot about yourself that you&#39;re okay with that scene where he locks her in the room with him.  Rape fantasy confirmed.</p>

<p>I like k-foids but at least I don&#39;t pretend that Park Shin-hye is anything more than a pretty face.</p>

At the risk of blowing your mind and throwing you into a mental health crisis, I accuse you of only watching basic bitch k-dramas for teenage girls.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I watch more sophisticated stuff like... k-dramas for women in their 20s.  Huh.  Suddenly I gotta go to Home Depot and buy some rope.</p>

<p>Imagine thinking I grew up on YA shit and not a bunch of highbrow books about British naval tactics in WW2 and stuff.  In my time you would get cyberbullied IRL by adults if you didn&#39;t know which divisions dropped at Zon and Nijmegen in Market-Garden.

    <div class="md"><p>Nah it’s pretty much just like k-drama but with less plastic surgery and japan being japan, they never cared to spread their entertainment throughout the world unlike South Korea. </p>

<p>Nowadays it’s super easy to get English dub and sub but when I was a kid, it was very hard to get a hold of these stuff. For some Japanese shows, the only way to watch them was through Chinese channels  with Chinese subtitles and/or dub lol just imagine. Japan never really put effort into breaking the language barriers. </p>

<p>Before k-dramas were a thing, us Asians watched Japanese and Chinese dramas. I used to watch sailormoon and Pokémon religiously when I’m was a wee baby but didn’t know what the fuck was going on because no subtitles.</p>
