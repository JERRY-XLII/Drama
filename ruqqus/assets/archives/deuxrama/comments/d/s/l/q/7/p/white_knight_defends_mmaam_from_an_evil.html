    <div class="md"><p>Every straight man wants to fuck another mans daughter, but no man actually wants his daughter to get fucked, its more something that men just accept because you have to expect to go through what your wife&#39;s father had to endure, if you plan on having children. There are however the rare cases of men who do what I referred to in my mind as &quot;Closing The Loop&quot;. Around that time when I was talking to my friends about this, about a week after the school scheduled for us to be given an inspirational speech by some rich white guy, basically all we heard were the same BS normie rhetoric which is just a denial of reality, you know like &quot;Just be yourself and work hard&quot;, statements that outright deny reality and the inherent advantages, genetic or otherwise, that differentiate everyone. One thing in particular that he said proved to me how lucky this guy was, he had multiple children and they were all boys, he said that he even kept trying to have a daughter but he only got sons, one of his sons even went on to become a millionaire. Seriously how fucking lucky is that, all I could think while sitting in that class, is that this lucky bastard closed the loop, without even trying. He got to fuck the shit out of the daughters of many men, but he will never be forced to live through the awkward phase of having to let an extension of yourself be sexually dominated by another man, he&#39;ll never have to face the awkwardly repulsive thoughts that a lot of fathers probably have to face, like the fact that in these times your daughter is likely going to be taking it in the ass, and will probably have all sought&#39;s of sick shit done to her. At the end of the day there are only two ways to close the loop, to only have sons by luck, or don&#39;t have any children at all.</p>
