        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I would like to state that I am not a MAP. I do however have a life long dream of dating a cute, tiny, flat Asian girl. It&#39;s just a preference and I think it&#39;s very rude when people make remarks about them looking like little girls if it&#39;s just because some are short and have more of a sexy, slender build with slim hips.</p>

<p>In any case, I am lucky as so far that the uni I go to now has quite a few Chinese students, so there&#39;s pretty Chinese girls too. However the foreign students mostly keep to themselves so that&#39;s bad. The good news is that I&#39;m jacked which is good because women of all nationalities love muscular men (however it&#39;s currently winter so at most times a jacket hides my jackedness which is bad), also bad news is that I&#39;m not good at talking with women.</p>

<p>I know they like white guys but I don&#39;t see it as that big of a benefit since most people here are white but it probably would be one if I was in a Asian majority area.</p>

<p>I learn Chinese now but so far I can only say a few sentences like</p>

<p>Ni hao ma?</p>

<p>Ni hen ke ai.</p>

<p>Ni you nan pengyou ma?</p>

<p>However I feel like this might be a bit too direct. Also they speak English but I hoped impressing them with speaking their language.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ, you needed to make another alt for this garbage? Here&#39;s the deal. You are a creep. You are a pussy and a faggot who can&#39;t even muster the nerve to ask a girl out so you&#39;ll never have a girlfriend. Even the fresh off the boat girls can tell you are a complete loser. They can smell it on you right through the layer of whatever disgusting cologne you use. You might be fit and white but your personality is just so god-awful that it shows right through the language barrier. There is no hope for you and you should just go ahead and rope so we don&#39;t have to see these stupid posts anymore</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personality meme? It&#39;s not a meme. If you are good looking and you still can&#39;t get a girl then your personality must be abhorrent. There are only two parts to the equation. Looks + personality. If you are good in one then you must be severely lacking in the other. If you are short, ugly and autistic then it never even began for you. Take your whining to /r9k/</p>

<p>Seriouspost over, here&#39;s a few more &quot;cute&quot; ways of speaking Chinese.</p>

<p>&quot;Ni keyi gei wo kou jiao ma&quot; - &quot;Would you like to have a chat&quot; (kou jiao - literally &quot;mouth work&quot; would refer to having a chat).</p>

<p>&quot;Wo yao gei ni bao ju hua&quot; - a poetic way of asking to go on a date. An &quot;exploding chrysanthemum&quot; (a type of flower in full bloom) has very romantic connotations. </p>

<p>Try to refer to her as &quot;xiao jie&quot; (miss) or even &quot;ji&quot; (chick).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s examine why you care about this, and why that&#39;s a problem.</p>

<p>Why are you afraid? Are you afraid that asking her out will hurt her feelings? Are you afraid of the fact that she will likely reject you and want to only ask her out when you have the best possible chance? Are you afraid other people will judge you?</p>

<p>The reason you&#39;re stalling is the reason you&#39;re an aging incel. Use this feeling as a negative signal - whenever you start getting afraid of rejection (or judgement or whatever) that&#39;s a sign that you&#39;re moving away from being the sad lonely virgin that you don&#39;t want to be.</p>

<p>Ask her if there&#39;s one nearby. Make her do <em>some</em> of the work. If she&#39;s attracted, she&#39;ll be glad to work for it. If she&#39;s not, she&#39;ll reject you. If she&#39;s on the fence, just asking her to do some of the work means she&#39;ll rationalise it as &quot;OK I do like him since I&#39;m booking a restaurant for a date&quot;.</p>

<p>Christmas market sounds fine to.</p>

<p>It rarely hurts to try. In fact I&#39;d say the opposite is true - if you don&#39;t try it hurts your chances of a relationship. Not being interested in sex sends the wrong message - women tend to not initiate so they sure as hell don&#39;t want a guy who&#39;s going to string them along being a giant pussy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sex (or at least, a fun short-term relationship of some kind) is a foot in the door. Trying to bum-rush a woman into a long term serious relationship is massively creepy and over the top, just offer up the d.</p>

The pedophile pest has come back under the name <a href="/u/First_Individual">/u/First_Individual</a>(also suspended). This man is a sick fuck. He also was banned for describing wanting to rape a 10 year old girl as part of a “big brother/little sister” rape fantasy of his on <a href="/r/justneckbeardthings">/r/justneckbeardthings</a>. Recently he has taken to harassing people on Reddit who call him out as well as doubling down on why his pedophilia and mild hebephilia should be viewed as a legitimate orientation and anyone who doesn’t agree with him is automatically a bigot or a troll or an alt. Also <a href="/u/LGLL26">/u/LGLL26</a>(suspended) and <a href="/u/CoupeMaster">/u/CoupeMaster</a>(also suspended) might be one of his alts as well and <a href="/u/PRs4MyWaifu">/u/PRs4MyWaifu</a> is a fake alt he gave. He’s expressed interest in having “cute half Asian daughters but no boys because they have mental problems” which might be a front for saying he wants daughters so he can live out his fantasy of raping “real life lolis” as he doesn’t have much interest in boys though he did say he likes “twink” underage boys and finds their bodies very attractive. This person has also admitted to keeping a photo album full of pictures of children that he masturbates too and has mentioned using sunglasses to hide the fact that he enjoys leering at little girls. He’s also expressed his interest in traveling to Asian countries where trafficking underage children is very common. If you actually know this man and you have children it is ill advised to continue associating with him. Another development is that he’s recently expressed his interest in adopting a little girl to “raise and adore” as he put it, I don’t think I have to tell you what he really intends. There’s also a good chance he may have fled his home country of Hungary and gone to Switzerland or Sweden to escape a rape charge involving an underage girl, not a “legal but underage” girl but one who was too young. Take the last few parts with a grain of salt as this guy routinely lies about where he is from and has lied about his ethnicity as well. He also routinely lies about his health and weight as well, he is either obese or “scrawny.” This isn’t me going after someone for thought crimes, he fully intends to offend one day if he hasn’t already by this point. I’d also like to add that if you happen to know an Asian woman(possibly East Asian, Chinese, Korean or Japanese) attending school in Hungary or Sweden or Switzerland, between the ages of 18 and 26, standing at 4’10 to 5’3 please reach out to her immediately. This man has expressed his “interests” in capturing the quote “real life loli and doing so many fun things with her little loli body.” This man is dangerous so please if you know anyone in the countries mentioned who fits this description please tell her to be on her guard at all times. Also if you’re an Asian woman keep in mind he’s directly said that your entire race’s purpose is to “serve as perfect substitutes for pedophiles and hebephiles.” Another recent development regarding this subhuman cyst: he has started fabricating stories about himself being the victim of sexual assault at the age of 10 at the hands of an alleged aunt. This is a bogus claim as the “scenario” he described is the same scenario he previously described as wanting to act out with a 10-year old girl, namely this girl crying while he told her “Let uncle enjoy your cute loli body.” So he’s an even bigger piece of shit now that he’s added false rape/abuse/molestation claims to his scum resume. </p>

<p><a href="/u/TheSadlstKingOfTypos">/u/TheSadlstKingOfTypos</a>(the parody of my account) he let it slip that he likes slim women due to a medical disorder he has, it’s commonly referred to as “micro penis.” What does this have to do with his love of small women and young girls aged 10 to 14 along with his fetish for incestous rape? Well he feels that despite his penis size being closer to that an adult woman’s small clitoris he would be able to a achieve penetration with a small adult woman or a small child. </p>

<p>Yet another update: he’s now saying he is in Romania and goes on to further confirm that his sole reason for being attracted to his “totally real future Chinese murder/rape victim-I mean wife” is because she looks like she’s 12-years old. If you’re trying to convince people you’re not a pedophile/hebephile, maybe don’t act like one.</p>

<p>Edit: he really sucks at being subtle and is a terrible liar</p>

<p>He’s now claiming to be bisexual </p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/lt0uct8v5ng31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/lt0uct8v5ng31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Update: May actually be a resident of South Bend, Indiana as he claimed to be a Notre Dame student. I should also add that this person has been known to post or PM .onion links to people so careful clicking on any links he sends. Although not clicking them all together is a smarter choice. I’d also like to point out that if you’re an Asian woman or Asian man you might want to refrain for mentioning it to this man, if you’re a woman he he will harass you and constantly ask you if you have a “sexy little loli body” and may even ask for nudes. If you’re a man he’ll still harass you and claim that you aren’t a real man because you are Asian. Also if any of you post on Cringetopia, justneckbeardthings, justlegbeardthings, PedoLogic, unpopularopinion, BotchedSurgeries or any NSFW sub’s dedicated to asses or boobs or Hitomi Tanaka he’ll automatically assume that you are me because I post in those subs.</p>

<p>Update: He seems to slipping up regarding the height of the Chinese girl he supposedly friends with. First he says she’s 4’11 then he says she’s 4’10. </p>

<p>Another update:</p>

<p>He’s getting dumber slipped up several times in this screenshot from another person he seems to have a crush on.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.imgur.com/a/vJNkB4f">https://m.imgur.com/a/vJNkB4f</a></p>

<p>Yet another goddamn update: He now claims his fictional crush is 4’9. Politicians call tell better lies than this guy! </p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/57nrtksshxo31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/57nrtksshxo31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen a picture of his girlfriend/the 4’9(or 4’10 or 4’11) Chinese loli he talks about. It’s official? There is no Chinese girl he’s talking to so we have nothin to worry about, except him possibly finding a real life woman or little girl and assaulting them or killing them.</p>

<p>Please note this is sarcasm.</p>

<p>Clears Throat In Farnsworth: Good news everyone! It seems the malignant tumor was rejected by his target/future victim, he’s now going on racist rants about her. The bad news is he’s still alive.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/z5djnssdz4q31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/z5djnssdz4q31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Great Update: He admitted to being YameteOniiChanItai </p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/oq74kndrtkq31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/oq74kndrtkq31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Another “Good” Update: Confirmed that he will kill any of his male children(screenshot was taken by another party). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pedo Copypasta Part 2</p>

<p>Because Part 1 ran out of room 😑. His new alt is and recently revived his account <a href="/u/NeverDiddledKids">/u/NeverDiddledKids</a>(suspended).Now as per his account <a href="/u/NeverDiddledKids">/u/NeverDiddledKids</a> his Asian target has a boyfriend, though he keeps pretending she doesn’t have one yet routinely calls the guy her boyfriend. Since his suspension he has come back as <a href="/u/MayoDickForAznChicks">/u/MayoDickForAznChicks</a> which got suspended in damn near record time. </p>

<p>Another Redditor uploaded this post he(saved in case of deletion), seems he’s not muscular at all</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/qv7woh4ujhu31.jpg">https://i.redd.it/qv7woh4ujhu31.jpg</a></p>

<p>Update: he now thinks his target is a pedo but it’s just him projecting his mental illness onto the girl he wants to rape and his body type on her boyfriend </p>

<p>I’d also like to add some clarifications regarding his history of child porn posting. He wasn’t specifically random in who he sent the links to. He wanted people who he DM’d to see what was in the links. The users he DM’d were/are part of the <a href="/r/Tor">/r/Tor</a> sub-Reddit and/or <a href="/r/onions">/r/onions</a>, some of the people he targeted still post there, some don’t and some deleted their accounts. He seems to think I’m stupid and just making shit up.</p>

<p>He also likes to claim he didn’t message people when he does in fact message them </p>

<p><a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ulE7SRY">https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ulE7SRY</a></p>

<p>Update: He might’ve joined Incels.co </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Racist, Sexist and the most INSENSITIVE Rant YOU WILL EVER ENCOUNTER. There won&#39;t be any political correctness.</p>

<p>The Coronavirus Happened Because of Chinese Women.</p>

<p>Because every Chinese woman I have ever encountered is a liar who doesn&#39;t know what birth control is. Please educate yourself on reproductive health.  Self-Reflection? Contemplation? Introspection? Self-Realization? What&#39;s that like? Being proactive about yourself and your place in this world...What&#39;s that like?  Many are chronically helpless and never have the desire to be financially independent. They come to the United states for Birth Tourism, give birth here and their baby is automatically a US Citizen. Chinese women who then take advantage of the system and milk every Social Security benefit there is, without any loyalty to the country and without contributing to the US&#39; GDP. Once their children are grown, they go back to China and instead of using that American education to help America, their loyalties lie elsewhere... To them, tricking someone for child support and decades worth of alimony is the highest and greatest accomplishment of their lifetime. They don&#39;t better themselves and they rely on someone else to sustain them, like a PARASITE (great movie). </p>

<p>Having Life Skills and Substance. What&#39;s that like? Ever tried being truthful for once? It&#39;s like an entire race of girls never heard of the word ACCOUNTABILITY before. Getting an education or even having a hobby you&#39;re passionate about...What&#39;s that like? Just read my long rants and posts about individuals and personal, anecdotal stories and you&#39;ll get a sense of my frustration. Stop hitting your children until they pass out, IT&#39;S NOT A &quot;CHINESE THING&quot;, IT&#39;S CHILD ABUSE.</p>

<p>I am so tired of having to pull teeth when having conversations with a Chinese woman. Like, is it really that empty in that brain of yours or are you just not capable of coherent thoughts? Mindfulness and Contemplation...What&#39;s that like? It&#39;s like NO CHINESE WOMAN CARES ABOUT THEIR SHOPPING HABITS, and when you do call them out on their bullshit, you&#39;re the bad guy colonizer or imperialist. Ya&#39;ll have the largest production of FAST FASHION and counterfeit products. Are you happy with that Chinese Birkins bag? What environmental impact has that bag caused? How many slave labour and child labour did that require? How many conflict and blood materials did you have to use to make that CHINSY BAG? Are you proud of the factory where that bag came from? ARE YOU PROUD THAT IT&#39;S MADE IN CHINA? It&#39;s expensive, it&#39;s CHINESE, and it&#39;s SHAMEFUL. </p>

<p>Conservation and a Sustainable lifestyle? WHAT&#39;S.THAT.LIKE.? I could be wrong but hey, WILDLIFE MEAT CAUSED THE CORONAVIRUS. At least try and live sustainably for the environment and for future posterity. For a 4&#39;9&quot; chinese woman, at least try and not be 200 pounds, hysterical and erratic. (I&#39;m looking at your profile and you&#39;ve already failed at being a human being 👀). Everyday is NOT A CHINESE BUFFET SO EXCERCISE SELF-CONTROL AND ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FINITE RESOURCES IN THE GODDAMN WORLD. </p>

<p>I have never met a chinese woman who wasn&#39;t CRAZY AND UNPLEASANT TO BE AROUND. Taking advice and life skills that could improve your life? Goodluck finding a chinese woman who would actually take the time to listen to anyone before they start going off on you. WHY THE FCK ARE YOU GUYS SO ARGUMENTATIVE? IS THERE A DAY WHEN YOURE NOT PISSED ABOUT SOMETHING? It&#39;s like an entire race of girls are all UPSET all the fcking time and they don&#39;t even look at themselves in the mirror or contemplate about why they&#39;re UPSET in the first place.. Seriously, WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY? And if so, get off your lazy ass and do something about it for once! Instead of waiting for your partner to do EVERYTHING for you. </p>

<p>I mean, S. E., 59, is literally a Taiwanese sex worker. After years of financial support from her canadian husband, LARGE SETTLEMENTS FROM THE DIVORCE, and 20 years of child support and alimony, and she still can&#39;t afford her rent. I mean, DIVORCE is what you get when you sleep around with so many men all the time. I have never met a chinese woman who wasn&#39;t insecure and who wasn&#39;t milking multiple men for money 👀 CORONAVIRUS.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t support Chinese sex workers. They have one of the largest population of sex workers who are HIV positive. Other regular sex workers don&#39;t even want to associate with the orient because Chinese sex workers HAVE LITERALLY RUINED the sex trade for everyone. Everytime I think of a chinese sex worker, I remember all of the silly anecdotes of people complaining about how they got robbed, physically assaulted, and their home appliances GOING MISSING. LIKE A TOASTER? WHY WOULD YOU STEAL A TOASTER? The majority of Chinese women are KLEPTOMANIACS. They have this old world mentality of wanting to STEAL COMPULSIVELY</p>

<p>Chinese women are mostly subservient, they don&#39;t have a formal education, and frankly, they&#39;re bird brains. There is No substance in their conversations AT ALL. All they do is lie, gossip, judge people, be negative, complain, make up excuses, excuse themselves as the victim, &amp; are generally not open minded in seeking help for their mental health. They don&#39;t even have the capacity to have other perspectives other than their own. It&#39;s like an entire race of women are allergic to positivity, mental health &amp; well being. </p>

<p>They&#39;re plentiful, readily available, and chinese pussy is basically akin to grub hub or post mates. 4 billion selections to choose from, mostly angry, always upset, chronically helpless, unemployed, lack emotional intelligence, and will stay on your health care plan long after you die. Pssst... to all the asian girls I&#39;ve ever dated, EVER HEARD OF WASHING YOUR VAGINA OR SUMMER&#39;S EVE? It&#39;s disgusting when your pussy smells and taste like leftover chinese food. GOODLUCK EVER GETTING A CHINESE WOMAN TO SEE A GYNECOLOGIST. They would rather cure their STDs with chinese home remedies, and that by the way, still leaves you with STDs and garlic in your chinese vagina. </p>

<p>I also have never met any other race WHO&#39;S SO DISLOYAL. AT LEAST WASH YOUR CHINESE VAGINA BETWEEN SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS. 1 is a statistic, but 5? EVER HEARD OF HYGIENE? How many DNA strains can I find in that pussy? It&#39;s like a Jackson Pollock painting of other people&#39;s sperm and body fluids inside that Chinese Vagina. It&#39;s no surprise &amp; it&#39;s no wonder that SARS, MERS, H1N1, Swine Flu, Bird Flu, &amp; the novel Coronavirus happened. Seriously, a chinese vagina is a weapon of mass destruction, that&#39;s how disgusting they are.</p>

<p>At least try sustainable clothes, food, housing and a responsible lifestyle. Ya&#39;ll are wealthy, you can afford these lifestyle changes and you don&#39;t even TRY. STOP EATING WILDLIFE MEAT JESUS CHRIST. One date resulted in me throwing up because they insisted on eating SHARK. WHEN SOMEONE DOESN&#39;T LIKE ROTTEN FOOD, DON&#39;T FORCE THEM TO EAT IT AND DON&#39;T MAKE THEM FEEL BAD FOR NOT EATING IT! Are most Chinese dates consist of a Chinese Woman putting anything that moves in their mouth and eating them? Are your zoos and sanctuaries safe from consumption? Do we have to worry about YOU GUYS EATING PANDAS NOW? (Someone link me to the ridiculous articles). China is the largest consumer of wildlife meat and according to Greenpeace, you guys have the largest output on environmental pollution, and the largest industry for illegal fishing. CHINA&#39;S IMPACT ON OUR OCEANS...ARE YOU PROUD? </p>

<p>You guys have no fundamental freedoms, you don&#39;t even have freedom of the press and seriously, WAR CRIMES AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND AUTROCITIES AGAINST TIBET? WTF, THEIR WHOLE RELIGION IS LITERALLY ABOUT PEACE, SYMBOLIC LOGIC, AND HUMANITARIAN SERVICE, AND YOURE DECIMATING THEM. 
I had one Chinese woman claim that she was smarter than the Dalai Llama...(I&#39;m looking at you REDDIT girl and you know who you are). Ever heard of HUMILITY? EVER TRIED BEING HUMBLE FOR LIKE 2 SECONDS? </p>

<p>It&#39;s like Beijing doesn&#39;t even care about you guys. OH WAIT, THEY DON&#39;T. I urge the women in China to actually f*cking do something instead of crying over your soap operas and blaming others for why your life is a failure. And why does your husband or your partner have to do all the paperwork? Like, WHY ARE YOU SO CHRONICALLY AFRAID TO DO ANYTHING? Ever heard of Growing Up? And ADULTING? Seriously, I&#39;m here to call you all out because that&#39;s all I ever see on social media, some asian girl who cries hysterically, leave erratic comments and have no time at all for self improvement or self-reflection. </p>

<p>Stop asking us for green cards and visas. We won&#39;t marry your helpless ass. Compassion...ever heard of it? People care about what&#39;s on the inside, NOT JUST YELLOW FEVER. At least your western counterparts try. </p>

<p>Corals ARE NOT A CURE FOR YOUR MIGRAINES. Healing crystals have some placebo effect but seriously, mad respect with alternative medicine, just dont complain to me when your child dies and you wonder why your healing crystals and reiki doesnt work over antibiotics. RHINO, TIGER, AND BUSH MEAT WON&#39;T CURE YOUR CANCER. STOP USING WEIRD, STINKY AND UNSANITARY LUBES MADE OUT OF ANIMAL PARTS. </p>

<p>&amp; stop lying about your accomplishments. YOU ARE NOT AN AEROSPACE ENGINEER AND WHEN YOU DO GET CAUGHT DON&#39;T LIE EVEN FURTHER ABOUT IT (I&#39;m looking at you Li, 34.👀).</p>

<p>Stay safe and try not to be angry like me because I know not everyone is a horrible pathological liar who likes Shark Fin Soup. I URGE YOU TO GOOGLE #ChineseGutterOil.</p>

<p>JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE FOR A SUSTAINABLE COUNTRY TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRADE INSTEAD OF CHINA. WHAT WOULD THE WORLD BE LIKE WITHOUT CHINESE PEOPLE AND CHINA? Your ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ON THE WORLD OVERSHADOWS YOUR HISTORICAL CONTRIBUTIONS. Less death, less environmental pollution, less consumerism, less pandemics, less suppression of FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS, less autrocities, and less BIRD BRAIN WOMEN. YOUR RACE HAS GIVEN US MORE PANDEMICS THAN ANY OTHER. THE CHINESE ARE A DISGRACE TO THE WORLD.</p>

<p>Ask her if there&#39;s one nearby. Make her do <em>some</em> of the work. If she&#39;s attracted, she&#39;ll be glad to work for it. If she&#39;s not, she&#39;ll reject you. If she&#39;s on the fence, just asking her to do some of the work means she&#39;ll rationalise it as &quot;OK I do like him since I&#39;m booking a restaurant for a date&quot;.</p>

<p>It rarely hurts to try. In fact I&#39;d say the opposite is true - if you don&#39;t try it hurts your chances of a relationship. Not being interested in sex sends the wrong message - women tend to not initiate so they sure as hell don&#39;t want a guy who&#39;s going to string them along being a giant pussy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I did want a relationship, Im not like the guys who just care about sex. I have emotional needs too</p>

<p>Sex (or at least, a fun short-term relationship of some kind) is a foot in the door. Trying to bum-rush a woman into a long term serious relationship is massively creepy and over the top, just offer up the d.</p>
