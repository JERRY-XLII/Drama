<p>Why do I do this? Because society has decided that everyone must work for a living, and if you&#39;re not fortunate enough to be born to a wealthy family or stupid enough to pay 100,000 dollars you don&#39;t actually have for a piece of paper, all of the decent jobs are locked up away from your reach </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t normally do this, but looking through your post history if I could give you one piece of advice it would be to not buy in to the personality stuff (INTP). You start to define yourself by it and then even in situations where you&#39;d have the potential to be outgoing or talkative with people you&#39;ll end up believing the excuse of &quot;that&#39;s just not who I am&quot;. </p>

<p>Some people are more social than others, but that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t make an effort to be outgoing. Connections are far more valuable than skills or education, and they&#39;re how you get out of that pit.</p>

<p>Then again I&#39;m firmly against the idea of taking advice for anyone on reddit so do what you think is best, but don&#39;t take it out on the people around you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...like, Personality and behavior related factors? Because that sounds like it&#39;s creeping into racist/bigot territory. Fuck, hate might just be too strong a word. It might just be that I&#39;m consistently disgusted and disappointed by the human race and I don&#39;t really know what to do with it. I definitely think there was a point in my life when I could have described it as hate, but now, with the perspective of age, it just feels more like Apathy.</p>

<p>Hey, I got a question you might be able to answer for me. What do you guys call subreddits like this? Where trolls bring their trophies? Because I always thought of them as hunting lodges,  and now I can&#39;t get this image of a bunch of gnarly looking  literal trolls sitting around long tables munching on halfling cutlets and swilling some awful variation of beer...</p>
