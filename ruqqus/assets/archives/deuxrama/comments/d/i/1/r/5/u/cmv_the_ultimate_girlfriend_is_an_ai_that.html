        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Kinda like unity from rick and morty without the vomit or other disgusting biological functions(Robot girls don&#39;t poop and are therefor superior). Or the Tines from the classic sci-fi novel A Fire Upon the Deep.</p>

<p>Just think about it, as far as your primate brain is concerned, you&#39;d be smashing multiple 10/10&#39;s every night, and consistently surrounded by hot girls as she/they follow you around. At the same time, your more senstive side gets to form a deep emotional bond with a single entity.</p>

<p>You basically get a full harem with none of the drama. In fact, the robot girls could coordinate with each other in superhuman fashion, both in bed and in your day-to-day life. Just imagine going to bed and falling asleep with both a big-tiddie 6&#39; girl who takes on the role of the big spoon and cuddles you at night, while simultaneously you get to cuddle a petite girl who takes on the role of the little spoon. A waifu sandwitch. Alternatively, if the robots are made of a light and soft material, you could have a full blanket of made up of robot girls completely surrounding you in their warmth. Has any man ever had the chance to experience such bliss? Probably, but paying for that many hookers probably costs an arm and a leg.</p>

<p>The fact that they&#39;re robots also brings multiple advantages. For instance, you will always have a backup of your girl, so you never have to worry about her getting ill or dying. (This is extra good for men because we have a tendendy to leave our women when they get sick) In addition, robot girls will never age, and since it&#39;s a hive mind, if you ever get bored of an individual robot, you can always just get another one. It&#39;s the equivalent of paying for a new haircut for a human gf. As another example, imagine a situation where one of them gets their hand damaged. You order parts for her on amazon and they come in the next day. Then your robot girl sits down in your lap, enjoying her nichrome-enabled warmth as she lets you gently fix her most intricate and delicate parts. Has any man experienced the intimacy of gently fixing their wife? Probably, but I&#39;m guessing it wasn&#39;t that enjoyable. Human women tend to release blood curdling screams when they&#39;re taken apart.</p>

<p>To top it all off, by having 5-12 bodies, that means 5-12 times more computing power. Even better, put half of it in the cloud! She could be multiple times smarter than you. Just imagine working on your homework, wrapped in the warm embrace of the tall girl, while simultaneously, another copy is giving you pointers on how to carry out that integral. Has any man ever fufilled their high school fantasy of getting 1-on-1 tutoring from that cute nerdy girl? Probably, we&#39;ve all been there, right? It was the tits.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s an AI, she can be programmed to have an optimal personality. For instance, do you want a willing slave gamer grill? You can have it. Or a domineering maid, who will push you down and have your way with you without provocation? You can have it. Although that&#39;s not really my cup of tea. Personally, I&#39;d rather a waifu that provides me with emotional support, and encourages and amplifies all of the facets of my personality that I most value in myself. In either case, you don&#39;t have to worry about her leaving you. In fact, she can be made to fight to the death to protect you. Has any man ever experienced the comforting security of being pulled out of a buring building by his super strong wife? Probably, but I know for a fact that there isn&#39;t a biological girl on this planet strong enough to drag my 350 pound ass out of a dangerous situation.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think I&#39;ve made my point and I&#39;m just about to COOOOOOM. Have a nice day and thank you for listening to my TED talk.</p>
