    <div class="md"><p>Howdy, my name is Rawhide Kobayashi. I&#39;m a 27 year old Japanese Japamerican (western culture fan for you foreigners). I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle&#39;s hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a few posts come through about the issues the Stack Overflow Community are facing, but it occurs to me that I&#39;ve never actually come across this Community in all my years using the site.
My best guess is that deep down in the meta corners among moderator types, there is some form of interpersonal communication going on, and sometimes there must be difficulties there. But for me, and I assume most of the people who will ever use the site to ask and answer silly JavaScript questions, that&#39;s something we&#39;re never going to see.</p>

<p>I used to answer a lot of questions on Stack Overflow, until eventually it became big enough that the Internet Point Chaser personalities were just too quick on the draw to answer anything and everything. Cool. That was the plan all along I guess. So now I just use it to google the order of arguments in date conversion functions for languages with poor documentation, which I assume is what roughly 100% of the people using the site do.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that aspect of the site will suffer from controversy like this in the long run.</p>

<p>SO was explicitly designed to attract those personalities to author all its content. Now it has the content they have served their purpose and this is the transitional stage where they are purged.</p>

<p>If I had to guess I would say they were just not a profitable demographic for SO to advertise to. If you are an expert with your own network do you need SOâ€™s job board, for example. They are trying to pivot to sell low-end services to n</p>
