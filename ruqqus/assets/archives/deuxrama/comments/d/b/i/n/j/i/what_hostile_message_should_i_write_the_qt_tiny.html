<p>I&#39;ve been thinking of the following, which should I pick? </p>

<p>&quot;Show pussy, riceslut.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know you&#39;re pedobait and look like a little boy, right? You should be happy I was interested in you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would ask you for nudes but I fear I&#39;d get arrested for it if the police found the pictures.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I hope you and your future 5&#39;4&quot; 120 lbs Chinese husband will be happy with each other.&quot; </p>

<p>Alternatively I&#39;m also open to other suggestions.</p>

<p>Since she loves me so much she chose to break off contact with me since she couldn&#39;t bear it. It&#39;s a traditional story of love against societal standards. I hope she&#39;ll come to her senses and realise that she doesn&#39;t have to marry him but can be with me instead.</p>

<p>Nigga I don&#39;t know what is and isn&#39;t real with you. I&#39;m still 99% certain you&#39;re an overly dedicated gimmick account. But on the off chance you aren&#39;t, please consider the following:</p>

<p>If your girl really has taken up with some Chinese guy, then whatever angry, cringy bullshit you try attack her with is not going to accomplish anything other than making an ass of yourself. But if she hasn&#39;t done anything like that, and instead there&#39;s been some kind of medical emergency, family crisis, whatever, some legitimate reason to go unresponsive... and then you start sending nasty messages like that... well then you&#39;ve seriously fucked up, son. Then you can kiss your waifu dreams goodbye, and it&#39;ll be your fault.</p>

<p>Come vent on <a href="/r/raceplay">/r/raceplay</a> and post some fucked up chink whore memes if it&#39;ll make you feel better. But leave the girl alone until she messages you back, even if she never does.</p>

<p>True which is why I just wrote her once some time after she got back, and it was a nice message too. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t get why she doesn&#39;t even read my messages. Her WhatsApp seems to work again and it says she&#39;s been online recently too ... </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t even hit on her and if she doesn&#39;t like me like that it&#39;s still useful to know other students since you can get material, learn for exams together and such. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m a bit confused by her seemingly ignoring me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well she&#39;s been back since Tuesday I think and I wrote her once when she was still in China as a response but she didn&#39;t get that until she got back because it barely works there. But she hasn&#39;t read that yet. And I wrote her yesterday asking her how shes been and about her trip and If she&#39;s been thinking about what classes she might want to take.</p>

<p>This is very depressing to me. I even worked out 6/7 days every week during my holidays just to look good for her :(</p>

That said, it also doesn&#39;t help that you&#39;ve built this girl up in your mind to be something she likely isn&#39;t. You&#39;ve got a serious case of one-itis.

<p>I know, right? Also not even reading what I wrote her. I find that weird too. </p>

<p>Also it just seems out of character for her. She&#39;d often write me on her own and seemed like a nice girl. </p>

<p>Yeah, it just feels bad though ... I meet someone cute and she seems nice too and then she just ignores me for no reason ... I&#39;m taking Chinese classes starting in October, I actually told her that too. Then I can hit on tiny Asian women in their native language :) </p>

<p>Oh, shit. Sorry, I thought she was on like a two week trip or something. I didn&#39;t realize she was studying over there. I&#39;m afraid I haven&#39;t been following this new season of <em>Yamete</em> very closely.</p>

<p>Yeah that&#39;s rough, dude. I&#39;d give her another week before accepting your loss. Try to keep your mind occupied with something else in the meantime. Keep hitting the gym, that&#39;s a healthy and productive outlet. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find yourself another tiny Asian princess soon enough. Just try to not obsess over here <em>before</em> you ask her out, yeah? That makes rejection worse by an order of magnitude.</p>

<p>It was like six weeks. Her family lives in China and she visited them. But she should be back since last week, and I&#39;ll go back next week or so. And she&#39;s here in Germany for another one and a half years. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah I guess. Weird part is that as I said even for studying reasons it&#39;s helpful to know others and also it&#39;s super likely for me to come across her since the place isn&#39;t that big which makes it weird for her to ignore and I&#39;m still not sure why she would. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if you see her again in person, it would be totally understandable and acceptable to ask why she stopped talking to you. I think you&#39;re entitled to an answer about that, if nothing else. But don&#39;t get weird or angry if you she gives you an answer you don&#39;t like. Just ask her kinda nonchalantly, like it&#39;s not a big deal, even if it is to you.

<p>I know, I&#39;ve been there. When you really like a girl, it can be difficult not letting your mind race way ahead of reality. It sucks. But still, there&#39;s no shortage of women who still could be that person for you. As unique as you think she is, she really isn&#39;t. You have a type, tiny 4&#39;9&quot; Asian women. That&#39;s fine. Even if this chick&#39;s one in a million, then there&#39;s still about 7,700 more women in the world exactly like her.</p>

<p>Plus, if you&#39;re working out even semi-regularly, you&#39;re already in a better position than a large percentage of your dating competition. Just tone down the creeper vibe a little.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even that specific though I do think slim Asian women under 5&#39; are the hottest. But I also liked her because she seemed like a nice and sweet person. It seems weird for her to do that ... </p>

<p>I&#39;m decently strong, at least compared to all people at my uni gym and most people at my other gym. If I get shredded I&#39;ll look really good. </p>

<p>That&#39;s mostly my goal soon until April, to get really lean so she&#39;ll see me again and then regret just ignoring me. But by then I&#39;ll walk with another cute Chinese girl hand in hand.</p>

I think you&#39;re entitled to an answer about that, if nothing else. But don&#39;t get weird or angry if you she gives you an answer you don&#39;t like. Just ask her kinda nonchalantly, like it&#39;s not a big deal, even if it is to you. You might have said it was for studying purposes, but she might have guessed you had ulterior motives anyway. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what motivates me tbh 😔 it&#39;s just depressing to me because I thought she could be that person for me</p>

<p>I know, I&#39;ve been there. When you really like a girl, it can be difficult not letting your mind race way ahead of reality. It sucks. But still, there&#39;s no shortage of women who still could be that person for you. As unique as you think she is, she really isn&#39;t. You have a type, tiny 4&#39;9&quot; Asian women. That&#39;s fine. Even if this chick&#39;s one in a million, then there&#39;s still about 7,700 more women in the world exactly like her.</p>

<p>Plus, if you&#39;re working out even semi-regularly, you&#39;re already in a better position than a large percentage of your dating competition. Just tone down the creeper vibe a little.</p>
