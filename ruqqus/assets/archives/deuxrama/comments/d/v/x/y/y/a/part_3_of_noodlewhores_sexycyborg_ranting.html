    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m tired of this fucking meme. Yes, gamers are hated by society for having no life, while the average person takes orders from the TV 4 hours per day. Gamers are hated on reddit, for wanting our moneys worth. Reddit is super liberal, until a gamer stands up to a corporation. Then it&#39;s oh that virgin gamer is upset that the female body is now covered. No, I appreciate art, culture, and the female body. The gamers rise up meme is hate speech against people with a video game hobby. Should we slut shame, or shame an alcoholic? No? Then STOP this gamers rise up nonsense.</p>

<p>Some people say- move to the West. They aren‚Äôt attacking me just because I‚Äôm in Mainland China, they are attacking me because I don‚Äôt fit their narrative. Moving won‚Äôt change that, just put me in closer proximity to an enemy that‚Äôs powerful and completely unaccountable even in their own country. They can do anything to me and nothing will happen, we‚Äôve seen this as fact. They would continue to attack me after I gave up my city for them, solving nothing. Moving closer to them is the absolute worst thing I could do.</p>

<p>Oh, no. The general degree of hostility I face from a small segment of the Western audience just for being me and looking like I do is massive. Slander is less an issue than people (apparently) actively trying to harm me- since I&#39;m in China the most efficient way to do that is to have the state act by proxy. If move to the West the same people will still have a problem with a whorish looking giant titty Asian girl trespassing on tech- and plenty of options to make my life inconvenient and unsafe. And I would have to change the way I dress and look in order to live in most cities in the West and that&#39;s important to me. All I really have to do to avoid problems in China is get off Western social media and pivot to hardware development manufacturing.</p>

<p>I sincerely doubt that unless you go to a muslim heavy part of Europe (it&#39;s not whole cities, but there&#39;s some neighborhoods), or go live with mennonites or mormons in the USA.</p>

<p>The giant tits might get stares in Europe where plastic surgery is less common, but women over there are pretty whorish (especially in hotter climates).</p>

<p>Yeah but that kind of stuff doesn&#39;t happen in the west so all they can do is talk trash and you seem fairly adept at defending yourself. Government agents aren&#39;t going to show up at your door because of a twitter feud.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But you don&#39;t. You show up in every thread where your name is mentioned no matter how obscure. You&#39;re in r/Deuxrama right now for god&#39;s sake.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Really depends on the city. You&#39;d probably get less stares in San Francisco than in Shenzhen. Also, don&#39;t you get cold? Every thin girl I&#39;ve ever met is constantly complaining about being cold and from what I&#39;ve seen you are usually wearing next-to-nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;This is my home and I like it here&quot; is a much better excuse than &quot;scary journalists are going to ruin my life if I move&quot; IMO.</p>

<p>Not journalists, but there&#39;s a lot more people there that wish me harm than here. But home is a big part of it also, and I&#39;ve said as much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll admit I don&#39;t know that much about you or all the shit that has happened with you. I watched one of your videos when you made that post in r/Drama like 8 or 9 months ago and I&#39;ll say that I don&#39;t think you are fake. You are obviously very smart and you seem like a typical crazy bitch so that all checks out. I&#39;ve seen the way you respond to trolls and it&#39;s always very measured but sometimes the best response is no response at all and it seems like you can&#39;t help yourself. Any press can be good press if you play it right and maybe that&#39;s what you are going for with all the drama. Having your patreon banned sucks but for fucks sake, if you are going to doxx someone like that do it from a sockpuppet account. You should get some cryptocurrency shit going. That&#39;s way more cyberpunk anyway.</p>

<p>Have you ever been to America? You should check out Los Angeles or Scottsdale. There is lots of tech stuff there and you won&#39;t even be the most skimpy-dressed, plastic chick in the room.</p>
