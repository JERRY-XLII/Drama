<p>I say this with caution here, but I think something has gone really wrong with the way we raise boys into men in our society.  We‚Äôve taken away a lot of institutions that teach them leadership and responsibility (like the falling membership in Boy Scouts).  We‚Äôve taken away dating rituals and encourage everyone to just ‚Äúhook up‚Äù instead.  We give them access to porn on their smartphones before they‚Äôve even hit puberty.  We‚Äôve taken away the idea of commitment being part of a sexual relationship - all they should look for is consent, and the porn teaches them even that is not needed.   There‚Äôs a dearth of steady jobs if they‚Äôre not in a professional class.  They‚Äôre stuck in a ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù, often unable to support themselves, let alone a family with a partner.  I think for many, ‚Äútransing‚Äù is a way out of a mediocre male experience.  Something has gone really, really wrong for that to be the best choice they see for themselves.</p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s called feminism lmao</p>

<p>I think things are even worse for women but women are more dedicated, hardworking, more prone to academic excellence and to slogging through tough situations so many women seem to be coming out on top even though it&#39;s obviously still harder for women and girls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because life is so difficult being a woman in a western country in the 21st century.
It&#39;s not like society has shifted its entire focus onto providing initiatives, support and attention onto helping women, while punishing men for a privelege younger males have never even experienced.</p>

<p>Could it be that a lot of guys are transitioning because they&#39;re jealous of the priveleges and easy coasting through life which modern woman have?</p>

<p>No, obviously it&#39;s the patriarchy.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t cope as a male and decide they were supposed to be female where that coping is optional.  Seems legit.</p>
