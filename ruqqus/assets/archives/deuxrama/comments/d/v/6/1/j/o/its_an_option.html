        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I got thrown out of a Freddy&#39;s Steakburgers and Fries a couple of days ago. A friend and I went in there to get some lunch at about 2:30 after we were running some errands in the area. It wasn&#39;t busy and we walked right up to the counter where we were met by a hulking, doughy, white, gangster-looking guy who was like 6&#39;6&quot; and 295lbs standing at the register counting cups. I looked up at the menu and since I already knew what I wanted, I was about to order but was cut short by the guy who said, &quot;you can order here or you can use the kiosk right there&quot; (about 3ft away) and continued to count his cups. I was kind of taken aback because we were the only customers around. My friend said, &quot;well what if we want to order from you?&quot; and the dude just gave us a dead-eyed stare and said, &quot;It&#39;s an option&quot; and continued to count his cups and not make any move to take our order. Straight up mogged the shit out of us. It was obvious that it wasn&#39;t really an option and if we wanted to put in an order we should deal with the robot. I was like &quot;What the fuck is with this guy?&quot; and my friend muttered something about shitty customer service. I rolled my eyes and thought, &quot;ok fuck this dude. I should probably just use the robot because this guy is going to get my order wrong anyway.&quot; My friend asked me &quot;should we just go?&quot; and I was like &quot;fuck it I&#39;ll use the kiosk&quot;. I proceeded to put in my combo order but when my friend did his it wouldn&#39;t add it to the cart and it kept glitching out and fucking up. In the meantime a girl who was an employee on a break or something (she was in uniform) walked up to the guy and proceeded to order stuff. I turned around and told the guy, &quot;your kiosk sucks man it doesn&#39;t even work.&quot; He said, &quot;Yeah the printer usually doesn&#39;t work either&quot; and I said &quot;well if it doesn&#39;t work why the hell are you pushing it on people?&quot; I&#39;m standing behind the girl ordering kind of crowding her against the counter because this guy is seriously fucking pissing me off at this point and he asks me &quot;How are the local sports team doing?&quot; (I&#39;m wearing a local sports team hat) and I look him dead in the eye and say, &quot;I dunno bud, are you going to take my fucking order or what?! I guess I need to talk to a manager or something.&quot;Â The girl completes her transaction and my friend I proceed to order from this dickmunch. We go to the booth and we are both like, &quot;WTF just happened? How was that guy such an unapologetic asshole? He&#39;s a fucking fast-food employee!&quot; I&#39;m practically shaking with rage at this point. My friend asks me for my receipt and I&#39;m like, &quot;yeah report these motherfuckers and have corporate rain hell down upon them.&quot; The website was wack so we promptly gave up. We got our food and could hardly get it down due to the ball of rage we were choking on. My friend suggested going over to the counter and dumping all the cups the guy was counting when we were leaving but I was like nah. As we were finishing up I noticed that the manager was interviewing a skinny mexican dude at a table next to the soda fountain. I went to refill my drink and then turned around to the manager and said, &quot;I hope this guy is going to be the replacement for that fat, lazy motherfucker at the counter over there&quot; and pointed at the big gangster dude. The manager immediately flipped out and jumped up and said, &quot;YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF MY STORE! HE IS AUTISTIC AND LEARNING DISABLED!&quot; I said, &quot;Well why the fuck are you letting him run the front of the house then?&quot; The manager kept yelling at me, &quot;HE IS AUTISTIC AND LEARNING DISABLED! HE IS PART OF THE something-or-other PROGRAM AND HE HAS WORKED HERE FOR TWO YEARS! YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF MY STORE RIGHT NOW!&quot; It was kind of obvious that the dude was the managers son or stepson or something like that just by how fucking pissed the guy got right off the bat. I told him, &quot;Well you should slap a sticker on his forehead or something so people know they are dealing with a retard because he comes off as incredibly rude.&quot; and walked out. I&#39;ve been laughing about the whole thing ever since and keep saying &quot;It&#39;s an option&quot; in any situation where it is remotely applicable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Howdy, my name is Rawhide Kobayashi. I&#39;m a 27 year old Japanese Japamerican (western culture fan for you foreigners). I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle&#39;s hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main problem was that the guy gave no outward appearance of being a tard. He was just some big wigger dickhead. If we are going to have a bunch of autists out in the real world interacting with people then we need some sort of signifier so you know you are dealing with a tard who needs to be treated differently than a normal person. I suggest that we have them all wear those little hats with propellers on them. That seems like it would be fun for everyone and many misunderstandings could be avoided.</p>
