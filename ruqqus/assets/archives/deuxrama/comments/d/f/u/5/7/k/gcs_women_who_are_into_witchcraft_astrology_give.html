<p>Not a copied post by the way 🙄🙄 I was offered to post this thread by someone and a man 🙄🙄 hijacked and posted it before I could 🙄🙄</p>

<p>Let’s unpack this </p>

<blockquote>
<p>men are into all kinds of nonsense that is considered to be credible and not dismissed outright like many female interests are (like certain religions or IQ stuff or Jordan Peterson type philosophies)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ummm nobody likes religiouscels &amp; the Kermit gets criticized constantly. His followers are labeled as alt right.  </p>

<p>It’s only fair that we ridicule the witchcraft nonsense as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I said I know there are bigger issues, but I can’t help feeling frustrated whenever I see women seriously believing in magic or witchcraft or astrology or anything like that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too, sis. Me too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally feel more positively towards “witchcraft” than any other religion is because - when you take away the woowoo - “witchcraft” was just a catchall term for “women stuff the church didn’t like”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, to fight back religiouscels, they find solace in something even more retarded?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We lost a LOT of valuable knowledge about women’s health when men chased women away claiming that what they were doing was “witchcraft” or “old wives tales”</p>

<p>As an example, a “witch” might have told an ancient Viking to put a silver chain in his wound to prevent it from getting infected. If she did, it would have actually worked, too, because silver has antimicrobial properties. Tracking the moon and stars could be used to determine the best time to plant things, tracking the weather is just meteorology, but to the scientifically illiterate this would just be seen as “evil witchcraft”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past, people lacked understanding about science and when something was not the norm, they thought it’s witchcraft. And it’s not just the women who got accused of using witchcraft. The most famous accused witch (or warlock) was Giles Corey. </p>

<p>To equate the dum dums in the past’s perception of what witchcraft is and women today believing in Harry Potter magic is intellectual dishonesty. They might as well believe the earth is flat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s because it provides a spiritual outlet for women that misogynistic religions don’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t fight stupidity with more stupidity. All it does is strengthening the religiouscels’ arguments about how women can’t think for ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thing with witchcraft and astrology is that they don’t teach that women are evil or sinners. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know what does that too? Not believing in any of this crap.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think a lot of women (myself included) are frustrated by secular religion, why would I go to church if the priest preaching to me thinks I’m lowly sinner just because I bleed once a month. I rather dance naked in the woods and believe in a Great Mother looking over me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But no one is forcing them to pick a lane. There’s no rule out there in a free society saying that you must pick a belief system. It’s not like, “be a religiouscel or a witch!” It’s not an either or situation. You can choose to be not this stupid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christianity as a religion has completely erase the female energy (which ancient religions had with godesses) and kept only the myth of a mother who also is a virgin, interestingly. I think intuitively women feel that religions don’t respect them, and they look elsewhere. They look for a spirituality that doesn’t tell them they are evil for enjoying sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this part. Abrahamic religions have put women in a passive role and made everyone a prude. That doesn’t mean that you need to become a witch, still.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I take it as a sign of enlightement and intelligence, personally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Awww sweaty, no 🤦🏻‍♀️</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Women were historically called “witches” for being herbalists, for not catering to males, for being intelligent, for accusing men of assault, and most women feared to even associate with a “witch” or any intelligent non-conformist assertive women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet we continue to exist in 21st century and not the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Women were called whores too for premarital sex. Does that mean you should become a prostitute in defiance because some people in the Middle Ages called some women whores? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men don’t take women scientists, academics, doctors, nurses, managers, or other professionals seriously.</p>

<p>Dropping astrology and witchcraft won’t make a difference</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It definitely wouldn’t go the other way if they actually dropped them</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hear what you’re saying but I also....don’t care what men think. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You go. Sis!</p>

<p>To conclude. I understand that some women in the past were ridiculed as witches for just being smarter than general populace and how that could have been the roots of what spawned feminism but this was not limited to women and these women were not doing witchcraft. They were just using their brains. If anything, with all the resources we have in this day and age, believing in this nonsense is an insult to these women who were ahead of their time. They are comparing women who were smarter than the general population even with limited education and resources back then with floozy idiots of the 21th century who could literally just google anything but choose to be dumber than the rest of the population. </p>

<p>For example, this is a scene from the Expanse where one of the characters, who is basically a low income space ship mechanic, was told that he would have been considered a highly intelligent person and made a lot of money if he was born long ago. </p>

<p>It is another layer of stupidity to compare people believing in nonsense as a way of defiance in the past to compare a person in a modern world who still believes in the same nonsense. </p>

<p>Men are still more retarded though.</p>
