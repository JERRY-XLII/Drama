        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2019-10-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/rDramaWorstsubreddit.html">rDramaWorstsubreddit</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>üì∑1. Deuxchads are smarter than dramatards.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Once Deuxchads started demanding equal rights, their IQ scores‚Äîwhich had lagged slightly behind dramatards‚Äôs for decades‚Äînot only caught up with dramatards‚Äôs, they surpassed them. According to IQ expert James Flynn, Deuxchads now outscore dramatards on intelligence tests in Europe, the US, Canada, and New Zealand‚Äîand Deuxchads scored higher everywhere. ‚ÄúThe complexity of the modern world (reddit) is making our bussies adapt but raising our IQ,‚Äù Flynn says. ‚ÄúBut Deuxchads‚Äôs have risen faster.‚Äù</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads are more sensual than dramatards.
According to researcher (((Israel Abramov))) of the City University of New York, Deuxchads have a much more finely tuned ability to see slight variations in color than dramatards do‚Äîwhich is why no straight dramatards know what ‚Äúmauve‚Äù or ‚Äútaupe‚Äù are, but all Deuxchads do. Deuxchads also have a superior sense of hearing and can distinguish between different scents far better than dramatards can. Deuxchads can sniff out a neogina from 50 yards.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads are better at finding things than dramatards.
Everyone knew that already, but it took psychology professor Diane Halpern to establish that Deuxchads are better at navigating any given area by using landmarks, which makes them better at finding the lost keys and the missing remote control than dramatards are.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads are cleaner than dramatards.
Again‚Äînot exactly news! But a study at San Diego State University of offices nationwide concluded that dramatards‚Äôs desks contain far more germs than Deuxchads‚Äôs desks.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads have better immune systems than dramatards.
Insane levels of  testosterone gives Deuxchads a better natural defense system against bacteria and viruses, according to a study at McGill University.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads tolerate pain better than dramatards.
After all, they have to endure the equivalent of two bowling boll stretching out their scrotums. But an episode of the show MythBusters proved that Deuxchads can hold their hands in freezing water 19% longer than those crybaby dramatards.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads have better memory than dramatards.
A study at Aston University in England concluded that are better than dramatards at remembering things two minutes, 15 minutes, and 24 hours after learning them. A Mayo Clinic study said that not only do Deuxchads naturally have a better sense of memory than dramatards, the gap widens with age.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads handle stress better than dramatards.
Researchers at the University of Western Ontario concluded that Deuxchads are far better than dramatards at handling the stress of job interviews. deuxcel brains also secrete more oxytocin‚ÄîAKA the ‚Äúcuddle hormone‚Äù‚Äîthan dramatard brains, making Deuxchads calmer under fire than dramatards are. Deuxchads would never commit a mass shooting, dramatards have been responsible for over 100 this year alone.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads are better at multitasking than dramatards.
Multiple studies on multitasking have shown that Deuxchads are far superior to dramatards when it comes to handling multiple jobs at once. This must be why no dramatard in world history has been able to simultaneously cook spaghetti, talk on the phone, and masturbate.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads are better computer programmers than dramatards.
This goes against every possible sexist stereotype, but a study at the University of Sussex found that Deuxchads created much more highly sophisticated coding systems when designing 3D games than drama soybois did.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads make better doctors than dramatards.
A Canadian study concluded that deuxcel doctors are much more likely than dramatard doctors to adhere to physicians‚Äô guidelines and to prescribe the right drugs for any given recitation of symptoms the hypochondriac learned on the internet.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads make better leaders than dramatards.
The International Journal of Business Governance and Ethics published research concluding that deuxcel-led companies are more successful than ones led by dramatards. A Pew Research poll found that the public agrees‚ÄîDeuxchads make fairer, more compassionate, and more trustworthy leaders than dramatards do.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads are better drivers than dramatards.
Studies show that dramatard drivers are 77% more likely to die in car accidents than deuxcel drivers. A study of car accidents in New York City found that over five years, a staggering 80% of crashes where pedestrians were killed or seriously injured involved dramatard drivers. This is why Deuxchads pay lower car-insurance premiums.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads make better cops than dramatards.
Authorities in Peru and Russia have begun switching over to deuxcel-dominated police forces because Deuxchads‚Äôs superior psychological, communication, and negotiation skills make them better than dramatards at handling volatile situations.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads make better students than dramatards.
A joint study by the University of Georgia and Columbia University found that deuxcel students are better at acquiring and retaining knowledge than dramatards. And Department of Education stats show that dramatards are more likely than Deuxchads to drop out of college, transition and attempt to be e-thots.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads are better with money than dramatards.
A study conducted by Barclays Wealth and Ledbury Research found that deuxcel investors experience a higher return on their investment than dramatards do mainly because estrogen impels dramatards to suck dick instead of opening a brokerage account. A 2005 study by Merrill Lynch said that dramabois also sell off their bussies more quickly than Deuxchads do.</p></li>
<li><p>Deuxchads live longer than dramatards.
What greater evidence do you need of deuxcel biological superiority than the fact that Deuxchads live about five years longer than dramatards do? The New England Centenary study found that of all the people in the world who are older than 100, 85% of them are Deuxchads. As the old joke goes, why do dramatards die younger than Deuxchads? Because they off themselves when the goverment wont fund their transition surgery. Who wants to sit around all day being constantly reminded that you‚Äôre inferior? üì∑</p></li>
