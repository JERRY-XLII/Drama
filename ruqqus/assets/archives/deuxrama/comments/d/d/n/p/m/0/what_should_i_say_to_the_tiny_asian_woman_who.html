And she&#39;s pretty easy to spot since she&#39;s basically a midget.  I&#39;d like to know why she&#39;d suddenly stop reading my messages or replying but I don&#39;t want her to know that she broke my poor, delicate heart. </p>

<p>I already have a plan for next summer which is to get shredded af so when she&#39;ll see me she&#39;ll regret ignoring me. But there&#39;s still a bit of time until that. What do I do if I see her again in the meantime?</p>

<p>I‚Äôd give a month before she eventually stabbed you. I‚Äôm not a fan of domestic violence, far from it, but for you I‚Äôll make an exception. Justifiable attempted homicide anyone? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know what I did that she doesnt like me apparently. </p>

<p>Probably because you asked her something incredibly offensive or retarded. Or she uses Reddit and visits cringe subs and saw some of your posts or maybe she went to <a href="/r/unpopularopinion">/r/unpopularopinion</a> and saw you there. Going no contact was incredibly smart of her. </p>

<p>And extremely humorous for me. Except for the fact that you seem like someone who might go on a killing spree because of this.</p>

<p>Nope, I did ask her one or two things but just about the city they live in. And last thing I wrote her was just asking how shes doing and how her trip back was and If she enjoyed the rest of her stay there. </p>

<p>Finding out someone you‚Äôre dating or friends with is in possession of child porn tends to make people feel incredibly hurt or angry.</p>

<p>Yet she‚Äôs still ignoring you. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll lie and come back saying that you‚Äôre talking again or that you met and knew regret event though you said some disparaging things about her body type. But then again you like children and not women who can think for themselves. Maybe that‚Äôs why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you not want me to find love with a cute, tiny Asian woman like her? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because your plans were to rape this girl and possibly groom any underage relatives of hers. You also said you wanted to rape your own daughters. You‚Äôre a pedophile and your kind is better off isolated, though preferably you deserve to caged up in some facility where people can run tests on you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She seemed really sweet, I don&#39;t get how I could have misjudged her so much.</p>

<p>Because you didn‚Äôt see her as a human being. That much was clear from the start.</p>

<p>I have no idea why either. I would like to know why. She hasn&#39;t even read the last two things I wrote her which seems weird. Could be a technical problem. </p>

<p>Yet you still sent people child porn and even posted some to sub-Reddits. There were images of kids, videos of kids. Playing dumb won‚Äôt save you. It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt click anything you send me. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Clearly that wasn‚Äôt enough for you so you decided to look up videos of real kids. Including shit, I was told as I know better than to click an onion link, that was borderline SNUFF. So looking at adult women who look like kids wasn‚Äôt enough for you anymore. How long until you actually go after a real kid hmm? Assuming you haven‚Äôt already. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes I did. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn‚Äôt. You never said anything solid about her besides her being short and small and said you found that she looked like a 12 year old very sexy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought she was adorable and a sweet person. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You barely mentioned her personality. You ever mentioned her personality actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She even said she would bring me something. That seemed really nice so I don&#39;t know why she&#39;d suddenly switch to ignoring me.</p>

<p>I can think of over several reasons, more actually. Any woman who avoids you or shuns you is quite intelligent. Along with having a strong will to live.</p>

<p>She seemed really sweet and seemed excited when I told her that I&#39;d soon get started with learning Chinese.</p>

<p>And what would she have to gain by pretending to be nice to me only to ignore me?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more likely she didn&#39;t see or didn&#39;t get my messages. Didn&#39;t even read them, which makes this more likely</p>

<p>Also she sent me a picture of a cute papercraft frog she made. It was adorable ‚ò∫</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For someone who claims to be ‚Äústudying Chinese‚Äù you don‚Äôt really know much about the Chinese language. I‚Äôm privy to this because reading is something I actually enjoy(yes us Rednecks actually read books) and because one of my co-workers married a woman from China and he actually wanted to learn the dialect of the province she was from even though she speaks fluent English she still spoke the language of the province she was from. Helped him out a bit in regards to what dialect he would be learning(in this case Xiang also known as Hunanese), can‚Äôt speak the language myself though but was still able to steer my boy in the right direction. </p>
