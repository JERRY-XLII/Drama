        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Note: All pictures in this post are SFW, in the sense that I avoided explicit drawings; the text is still obviously NSFW. For a book like this, that&#39;s like recommending Lord of the Rings while skipping any time the Hobbits are mentioned. So know you&#39;re not getting even 10% of what the book is. I just want to make you curious.</p>

<p>Fucking Trans Women</p>

<p>I highly recommend this little book by author Mira Bellwether, recommended in PhilosophyTube&#39;s latest video. Even if you don&#39;t fuck trans women for whatever circumstancial reason (for me, it&#39;s never happened and I&#39;m in a monogamous relationship), it&#39;s a really nice and short book to learn more about non-normative sexuality in a fun way. It&#39;s actually the issue #0 of a fanzine, but it has like 80 pages of drawings with text on top of them. It has been answering questions I hadn&#39;t even formulated, and it&#39;s all done with a radically practical intention. It doesn&#39;t drag on discussing the usage of the word &quot;fuck&quot; or if it&#39;s okay to call certain genitalia &quot;penises&quot; or if they should be called something else; it does acknowledge those discussions, but the goal is something else (SFW):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/dNI5Oir.png">https://i.imgur.com/dNI5Oir.png</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6esJCoZ.png">https://i.imgur.com/6esJCoZ.png</a></p>

<p>It truly has a beautiful &quot;made with glue stick and a photocopy machine&quot; look that I love, and the info is solid. Some topics it discusses:</p>

<p>Basic facts about penises and their nerve stimuly (for those bIoLogICalY obsessed)</p>

<p>How to relate sexually with a flaccid penis, and why they&#39;re great too</p>

<p>Tucking</p>

<p>How to better communicate with your partner</p>

<p>Peculiarities of the author being a woman that produces jizz, and how to deal with that (and off the side, why she&#39;s tired of talking about it)</p>

<p>But the best part of it, IMO, is that it so graciously balances all the stuff it needed to balance to make this kind of book. It is kind of a cookbook, as the author calls it, but it also has humor, advice, and very thoughtful and wholesome ruminations of the subjects it discusses. I doubted if I should make that bullet-list of talking points because it risks making a bad impression. The book is an act of meditation in fragments. The topics open the door to think about sex in general in a different light, specially if you have a normative body and the experience just hadn&#39;t be a regular part of how you think sex.</p>

<p>Plus, the section headers look like if someone took a snap of a Contrapoints video:</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to have it on paper, I think this link is for that:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fucking-Trans-Women-FTW-1/dp/1492128937">https://www.amazon.com/Fucking-Trans-Women-FTW-1/dp/1492128937</a></p>

<p>Although if you&#39;re dirt poor or if you live in the other side of the world, you can get it like I did, from a certain russian library that definitely does not have Terminator Genesis on it&#39;s stock (don&#39;t know if it&#39;d be illegal to link it to you? Anyway, PM me...) But it&#39;d be really, really awesome if you can support the author, she made an excelent book, and I don&#39;t think ten dollars is asking so much, is it?</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some more excerpts. I tried really hard to make them SFW (as in, no explicit drawings), so we&#39;re probably getting the least spicy parts. Also the more sex-normative parts. So if you want more, you know what to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might come as a shock to you, but I do not care about your opinions, your ignorance or failure to comprehend the research, or what you believe. The only thing I care about, and I can not stress this enough, is what the empirical research says. And it says you are wrong.</p>

<p>Your personal opinion? worth as much as a pile of dog shit on the sidewalk to me. That is the absolute extent to which I care about what you think. This is where I stopped reading. I do not entertain the economic illiteracy of far leftists or far right-wing tards.</p>

<p>Both are equally misinformed on average, both are failures.</p>
