    <div class="md"><p>hi, so <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/bmcasm/utrappysaruh_is_a_goddamn_uncle_tom_srd/emxy7fj/">i kinda addresses this earlier today</a>. </p>

<p>note in particular the lack of older (in yrs of transition) trans people that are involved in the broader transcommunity. in all my years of idling every kind of trans community, 1 constant: most of the people who are past their egg stage leave. theres a lot of reasons but the primary reason is that the transcommubity offers nothing to people who are &quot;done&quot;. trans forums are full of mental illness that can easily suck up any happyness you have, especially if you&#39;re looked upto. imagine helping someone get over suicidal idealation only to have to deal with it again day after day after day. </p>

<p>because of this, what u get in very large communities (/r/traa) is a culture of people coming in, trying to figure out what to do and who they are, being mentored by people who largely just months prior were asking the same thing. repeat forever.</p>

<p>finally, there is a general loss of purpose of life for, what seems like, most people. more people are online-only than ever before and a lot of people are deprived of deep fulfilling social connections.</p>

<p>so you have 3 elements: profound mental stress, isolation, and a community composed of people in the exact same stage as you.</p>

<p>what happens next has 3 stages:</p>

<p>1 -- conversion -- you have a vulnerable population (in the sense of confused and easily convinced by otherwise spacious arguments). communists come in and tell them that capitalism is the reason why they are suffering. capitalism and the systems embedded within it are the cause of the lose of purpose (living to make others profit isnt a fulfilling purpose). additionally, if it wasn&#39;t for profit above human suffering, HRT would be covered. SRS would be covered. everyone (not just trans but everyone) would be happier because they can work, or not work and do whatever they want and because of this hate and discrimination goes down. this means that the egg, whos likely greatest fear is &#39;looking like a 60 year old crossdressing transsexual&#39;, is now provided fuel and a target for theier anger: &#39;if i dont pass it is capitalisms fault&#39;, &#39;if im not happy its capitalisms fault&#39;, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0c2LjKdqqw">and so on and so on</a>.</p>

<p>this message is popular, and it is effective. trans people are generally left anyway so being pulled far left is certainly easier than being pulled into some rightoid bs. </p>

<p>2 -- memes -- enough transposters have been converted into communists that it causes a feedback loop. communist eggs start mentoring new eggs, who learn the glory of communism and the evils of capitalism. a critical threshold is hit where there are enough clever posters (most people are bad at posting) that can make decent memes. this causes a tsunami of commie and bash-the-fash memes and all the other memes transpower memes you&#39;ve seen. </p>

<p>meme subreddits come online at this point. once you know your trans, you dont really need /r/transgender and other misc subreddits anymore. they&#39;re more for questions about transitioning, hrt, news etc. so instead you create meme subreddits. meme subreddits are free-money in terms of subscribers, so they explode in size. meme subreddits quickly become THE trans subreddits, with /r/mtf /r/ftm /r/transgender and others being more specialized. </p>

<p>so back to the egg. imagine you&#39;re just starting to feel conflicted about your gender, and you look for information. what is the first subreddit you&#39;re going to find? /r/traaa and (lol) /r/egg_irl. what are they full of? communists. communism now becomes an implicit (not explicit) characteristic of being trans. </p>

<p>3 -- cult -- at this point, the commie meme is self sustaining. eggs come in already converted. communism becomes an important of the sense of community and friendship. everyone is friendly to each other, everyone is hugging and sqeueeing and &quot;uwu&quot;ing each other. &quot;you go grrl!!&quot;, &quot;fuck pigs and their bootlicking fascists&quot;, etc etc. </p>

<p>what do you get with a hyper-friendly community that welcomes all but also has an obvious outlet for hate? you get a cult. because communism has become so deeply embedded into the culture of these communities, any friction against communist ideas, even only slight friction, cause a swift and immediate response. this leads into 1 person trying to defend themselves against 10+ people. others who might have similar misgivings but don&#39;t want to be ebicly dunked on by their friends keep quiet. </p>

<p>loud people are loud, and transcommies are very loud. </p>

<p>everything is great, and any criticism of it means you must be a traitorous self-hating tranny who should leave. </p>

<hr/>

<p>i dont have sources for this or anything, its just my interpretation of watching the trans community since the 00s with a few embellishments. i might be wrong, or partly wrong, but its how i see it.</p>

<p>to make it clear, i dont hate communism. but i do hate communists. im very left and identified as a communist myself for a while. then i realized that 95% of communists are, literally, larpers. a lot of them would rather people suffer so that the world is a step closer to the glorious revolution then make things better right now, this moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trans part will definitely crash and burn. It reminds me of the prononun arc during Tumblr&#39;s history where you saw shit like &quot;buns/bunself.&quot; Even more people are larping as trans than commies since trans is such an effective social shield since if you lash out, you&#39;ll get #canceled. Eventually people will get tired of it and they&#39;ll latch onto the next trendy thing that allows them to vie for social media capita.

<ol>
<li><p>Cult-lite behaviour happens whenever you get a new community. Everyone is hyper-friendly looking to make new friends. WHY CAN&#39;T EVERYONE BE SO NICE IN THE REAL WORLD!? In reality, it&#39;s not that everyone is nice. Everyone is just desperate for attention and validation in a new environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a scapegoat. So people get deluded into thinking that everyone is nice (in reality everyone is just playing nice because they&#39;re new). Capitalists, communists, feminists, neckbeards, Christians, Muslims, Jews, any of these can work.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine if President Xi and Kim Jong-un start killing massive amounts of transgendered people. These people would have sectarian breakdowns, playing 66th Dimensional Chess to either defend the Chinese Communist Party and North Korea, or condemn them, be called a &#39;Western Imperialist&#39;.</p>

<p>If Stalin was resurrected today, seized power in Russia, he would probably kill massive amounts of trannies.</p>

<p>The Trannies would probably migrate to the anarkiddies, giving the Tankies a good reason to roll out the tanks against both.
And Daddy Trump&#39;s supporters might actually cheer on Stalin for killing both trannies and anarkiddies.</p>
