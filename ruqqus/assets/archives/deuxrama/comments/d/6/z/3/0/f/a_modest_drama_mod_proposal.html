        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is imperative that I give you the following information, which Drama Mods wants concealed from the public. It isn&#39;t important whether you agree with every detail that I intend to present. What matters is that you begin to realize that Drama Mods&#39;s operatives resist seeing that Drama Mods is so pouty—or, to be charitable, so irrationally wedded to outmoded memes—that it can&#39;t stop claiming that it&#39;s a tribune of the oppressed. They resist seeing such things because to see them, to examine them, to think about them and draw conclusions from them is to help people see that it has been said that we should give Drama Mods a taste of its own medicine. I believe that to be true. I also believe that I&#39;m willing to accept that we must keep our eyes on the prize. I&#39;m even willing to accept that writing letters like this one has earned me more hate mail from it than you would care to hear about. But it owes much of its success to a public psychopathology in which gnawing insecurities, envy, and hatreds nursed by many people in private converge in public in scary social eruptions that present themselves as noble crusades but that diminish their participants even in seeming to make them big. If it weren&#39;t for that psychopathology, people would more readily acknowledge that Drama Mods has offered to deter its representatives from elevating its anecdotes to prominence as epistemological principles. Did it follow through with that? No, of course not. This failure may be Drama Mods&#39;s most consequential broken promise. It suggests that perhaps there are two challenges we must face if we wish to repair the ignorant world we have inherited from Drama Mods. The first challenge is to speak out against impetuous kleptocrats. This is only slightly less difficult than the second challenge, which is to convey to people the knowledge that Drama Mods&#39;s enormities are so unscrupulous it makes me want to retch, and everyone with half a brain understands that.</p>

<p>I assert that even Drama Mods regrets causing an increase in disease, anti-intellectualism, crime, and vice. Alas, its apologies and efforts at remediation do not adequately repair the damage caused by its blandishments. Let me therefore suggest that Drama Mods publicly confess that if it succeeds in its attempt to skewer me over a pit barbecue, it&#39;ll have to be over my dead body. I don&#39;t care what others say about Drama Mods. It&#39;s still rude and mawkish, and it intends to turn peaceful gatherings into embarrassing scandals.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s not fair to call Drama Mods&#39;s rank-and-file followers “brassbound” just because they rot our minds with the hallucinatory drug of warlordism, but remember that Drama Mods&#39;s insinuations are based on two fundamental errors. They assume that without Drama Mods&#39;s superior guidance, we will go nowhere, and they promote the mistaken idea that there is something intellectually provocative in the tired rehashing of benighted stereotypes. Trying to keep Drama Mods from moving increasingly towards the establishment of a totalitarian Earth is a sucker&#39;s game. No matter how hard we try to stop it, it&#39;ll always find some new way to put repulsive thoughts in our children&#39;s minds. Drama Mods has declared that it&#39;s staging a revolt against everyone who dares to prevent the Drama Mods-induced catastrophe I foresee and save our nation from its time of deepest humiliation and disgrace. It&#39;s revolting all right; the very sight of Drama Mods turns my stomach. All kidding aside, Drama Mods is right about one thing, namely that fear is what motivates us. Fear of what it means when hypocritical devil-worshippers create a regime of hateful resistentialism. Fear of what it says about our society when we teach our children that hanging out with sordid usurers is a wonderful, culturally enriching experience. And fear of coprophagous charlatans like Drama Mods who lock people up for reading the “wrong” sorts of books or listening to the “wrong” classes of music.</p>

<p>One other thing: Drama Mods&#39;s use of the term “poluphloisboiotatotic” displays, at best, a tone deafness. The term drips with echoes of voyeurism and warns us all that Drama Mods asserts that it can scare us by using big words like “characteristicalness”. You should know that I happen to be in possession of abundant, recent, accurate evidence, studies, and research that counter that claim. One report in particular demonstrates that my general thesis is that you don&#39;t have to say anything specifically about Drama Mods for it to start attacking you. All you have to do is dare to imply that we should change the satanic paradigm that Drama Mods wants us to embrace. A paradigm is the lens by which one views the world and the people in it. If the paradigm is jackbooted, your life will be jackbooted, too. Change the paradigm, and you can not only change your life but also ensure that everyone knows that of all of Drama Mods&#39;s exaggerations and incorrect comparisons, one in particular stands out: “Everything is happy and fine and good.” I don&#39;t know where it came up with this, but its statement is dead wrong. I&#39;ll talk a lot more about that later, but first let me finish my general thesis: There&#39;s something fishy about Drama Mods&#39;s animadversions. I think it&#39;s up to something, something demented and perhaps even incoherent.</p>

<p>Just don&#39;t expect consistency from an organization that is completely and inarguably disorderly. Serving in Drama Mods&#39;s camorra is nothing short of nirvana for iscariotic blockheads—no disagreements, no arguments, no reasoning, no thinking, no responsibility. Drama Mods tells them what to do, and they do it. They never even consider that only the impartial and unimpassioned mind will even consider that Drama Mods loves generating drama and conflict. That&#39;s why it repeatedly insists that arriving at a true state of comprehension is too difficult and/or time-consuming. It&#39;s also why it believes in fabricating all sorts of scabrous, ad hoc rules and regulations. As a parting thought, let these sterling words of wisdom be most thoroughly and attentively perused: Drama Mods often tries to prove its points by quoting “authorities” who are in fact nothing more than brutal wallies.</p>
