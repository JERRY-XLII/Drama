        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve known  an Asian girl for a while. She seemed sweet, went on a trip for a bit. When I saw her again Tuesday she brought me a little box with sweets that had a drawing with a couple on the front and a heart on the side as a gift. So I figured she probably likes me too.</p>

<p>Today I walk back with her because she says she has to go in the same direction. Because she lives there? No, apparently her mayo boyfriend does, and she mentions she still has to go shopping with him (he has a car but she doesn&#39;t at the moment). Except she not once called him her boyfriend but just &quot;he&quot; or Jonas and she never mentioned having one. At first I thought she was walking to her place and I only slowly figured it out. Because it turns out she doesn&#39;t have a car, so how does she get there and back, well he takes her along. </p>

<p>So if I didn&#39;t happen to have the same way I wouldn&#39;t even have found out.</p>

<p>And earlier this week she mentioned him to me but like &quot;I know a guy who also takes (the class I&#39;m taking)&quot;.</p>

<p>So why does she do that? Think she&#39;s into me and was trying to hide she already had a mayo boyfriend? It&#39;s kinda shady from her and makes me think that yellow foids are just as cunning and deceiving as any other foids.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m very disturbed to find out that I apparently live right next to a fucking paedophile (or a closet homosexual, same thing really). I&#39;m sure the police would be interested in the contents of his hard drive, maybe they should have a look at it. How can I successfully report him?</p>

<p>I hope if they have a fight or break up I can console her and get with her. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to date her given her behaviour.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay that could be, hadnt considered it. </p>

<p>But it puts me in a bit of a bad position now. Before I didn&#39;t even know she had a boyfriend and she seemed to didn&#39;t want me to know either. But now that I found out that she has one I can&#39;t really ask her out or anything while before I could have since I didn&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Share your ancient wisdom about women with me</p>

<p>My current plan is to not do anything atm, just keep being friends with her and if I get an opportunity e.g. if they have a fight or break up she can come to me and I can console her and sleep with her.</p>
