        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>summary of <a href="/r/DeuxRama">/r/DeuxRama</a>: a bunch of socially awkward computer nerds who have no friends in real life and feel the need to make online friends they can hang out with. for some reason racism and bigotry is totally okay because it&#39;s funny, when in reality people just say things like &quot;dude bussy&quot; and dogwhistle with pitbull statistics because they are uncomfortable with their own hatred of negros and their own sexuality. also they just like to say vulgar things because they have the developmental minds of a 12 year old.</p>

<p>everything on this subreddit is so repeated, copied, unoriginal, forced, and beaten to death, there is literally no content left in it. it&#39;s like a broken record, repeating itself over and over and over again. for some reason everyone keeps coming back here to repeat the same garbage and come up with new garbage that isn&#39;t any more original or creative than the same shit this place has been spewing out for months now. don&#39;t even get me started about the satire. why the fuck does reddit need something that satires itself? if reddit is so bad and needs to be made fun of that much, why are you people even on this website? why are you making fun of chapos instead of doing something that actually contributes one iota of usefulness to the human race? why do you kids keep coming back here and partaking in the online circlejerk over shitposts, racist jokes, ugly CSS formatting, and uneducated watered-down socio-political commentary? because you&#39;re all addicted to the orangered. you want to see a little mail icon with a big number next to it, and you want your fake name to have a big number next to it to. seeing the orangered is an instant gratification stimulus that tells you that you are part of something. it doesn&#39;t matter how mindless or downright retarded it is. as long as you&#39;re considered part of a group and are constantly being awarded for a meaningless virtue called &quot;bravery,&quot; you&#39;ll keep refreshing the page like a junkie.</p>

<p>just look at the front page of the subreddit. half the posts are by users with green names. the mod team of <a href="/r/DeuxRama">/r/DeuxRama</a> makes up about 5 percent of all subscribers/viewers, but contributes something like 50 percent of all content. they live in their special secret club, the <a href="/r/DeuxRama">/r/DeuxRama</a> modmail, and only leave their jerking cave when they need to battle atheists, downvote a chapo, or post a link in order to get more karma. mod mail is like a channel where mods drop links to their shitty ass effortless posts and insist that all the other mods upvote them. everyone who isn&#39;t a mod is considered pure shit and doesn&#39;t get any attention from the mods, only from other non-mods. this leads to all these regular users kissing the asses of the mods day and night, hoping to earn their approval and upvotes, and even maybe get modded one day. if you&#39;re still reading, i feel sorry for you. my point is, if <a href="/r/DeuxRama">/r/DeuxRama</a> was ever worth anything, it has now gone to total shit, so peace bitches, i won&#39;t miss any of you, am off back to <a href="/r/Drama">/r/Drama</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I’ve noticed there is a lot of people who are extremely insecure about their height, and I think it’s insane!</p>

<p>I believe short men are much more attractive than tall men. I believe around 5’ and 5’5 is the perfect height for men.</p>

<p>For instance, the shorter you are, the easier you are to pick up and have anal sex. Guys who are tall usually weigh a lot more, and are harder to adjust it properly. In my experience men who are short also tend to be cuter than taller men, though that’s not a fact, it just happens more often that I see a cute small guy.</p>

<p>The weight is a major benefit, the fact that you can be 110 lbs without being super skinny is awesome. I can appreciate a man who is in shape but isn’t going to break my back trying to lift.</p>

<p>In conclusion, be happy about your height</p>
