<p>Hard hitting highlights üëèüèª </p>

<blockquote>
<p>realized I‚Äôd first assumed that Emily Doe was white, a reminder of how often we internalize whiteness as a default in America. Ms. Miller is more than her racial identity alone, but the knowledge that she is Asian-American necessitates a new understanding of what she experienced and how she was perceived ‚Äî <strong>as a woman of color, assaulted by a white man, trying to obtain justice in a courtroom presided over by a white male judge.</strong></p>

<p>Mr. Turner‚Äôs treatment during the case, and his light sentence, quickly became <strong>a symbol for many of elite, white male privilege</strong>.</p>

<p>growing up Asian-American had made her feel ‚Äúused to being unseen, to never being fully known. It did not feel possible that I could be the protagonist.‚Äù Asian-American women intersect with racism and sexism in ways that are shared by women of other races and also unique to us. It‚Äôs impossible to acknowledge <strong>the dehumanization of and violence against Asian women ‚Äî including hypersexualization, exoticization and fetishization ‚Äî without connecting it to a long history of American colonialism, imperialism and militarization</strong> in Asian countries.</p>

<p>between <strong>21 percent and 55 percent of Asian-American women experience physical or sexual violence from intimate partners</strong>, with rates varying based on ethnicity. We‚Äôve also been found to report rape and other forms of sexual violence less frequently than women of other races. A lack of financial resources as well as trauma, immigration status, risk of alienation from families and communities, and mistrust of the criminal justice system</p>

<p>The legal system and academic institutions have historically been invested in <strong>protecting wealth, white supremacy and patriarchy</strong>. Women, both cis- and transgender, are disproportionately affected by sexual violence</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They name several different issues, lump them together and act like they prove each other.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;He got a light sentence because white male privilege and he is wealthy.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess there is proof that white people actually get lighter sentences than black people. However, there is also proof that women actually get much lighter sentences than men, no matter which skin color. So this one is just plain wrong. Also, I think I also read that there is no proof that rich people get lighter sentences.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Sexualization of Asian women due to colonialism.&quot;</p>

<p>This one is just stupid. East Asia is one of the least colonized areas on earth. Like, every African country except Ethiopia is a former colony. Both North and South America were colonies. Australia, too. Only Asia and the middle East were mostly no colonies. So how the fuck do they think that this is related to colonialism?</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Asian American women experience sexual violence.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, no fucking shit. But this is a worthless statement if you have no idea how much. Also, I like how they mentioned &quot;with rates varying based on ethnicity&quot;. Sure they would have mentioned if white males had the highest rate of assaulting them. Guess the data showed that black and probably also Asian men are more likely to assault women, so they did not want to mention the actual numbers.</p></li>

<p>Well... The British held Iraq and Afghanistan, Hong Kong, and some parts of China (Opium Wars anyone?) And we won&#39;t mention India</p>

<p>The French were in Beirut and that area in the mid-late 1800s, and vietnam/burma/Laos</p>

<p>But even so... as far as colonialism goes, Asia had it easy compared to South and Central America. Thanks Cortez and Bilbao and the other Conquistadors!</p>

<p>But any exotic woman of a newly discovered land is going to be lusted after by some (except Australian aboriginals, cause... come on... just look at them) cause men are horndogs, especially after being on a ship full of other men for 5 months, and the cabin boy died 3 months into the trip.</p>
