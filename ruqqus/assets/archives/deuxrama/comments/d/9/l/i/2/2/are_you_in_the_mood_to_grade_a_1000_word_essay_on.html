<p>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever watched cuckold-style porn, but there&#39;s a <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph558857e7d73ba">particular one</a> where a guy, his wife, and his friend are playing a poker game; the friend keeps winning, and the guy eventually bets and loses his (very drunk) wife, who the friend then fucks. The key to understanding that porn is that the viewer isn&#39;t supposed to identify with the friend. He&#39;s supposed to identify with the guy, who stays in the room and watches, drinking and occasionally appealing to one or both of them to c&#39;mon, the joke&#39;s over, cut it out. Him being there and watching and sort of pathetically, ineffectually opposed to it makes it, to be frank, hot. It&#39;s not just sex - it&#39;s forbidden, consequential, emotionally devastating sex.... That&#39;s what gives the scene its emotional power and oomph, its sense of being dangerous and naughty and forbidden.</p>

<p>I&#39;m physically repulsed. Contempt and revulsion. Cucks are the worst, and I am worse off for seeing this horseshit erotica.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was narrated from Salim bin &#39;Abdullah that his father said:</p>

<p>&quot;The Messenger of Allah said: &quot;There are three at whom Allah will not look on the Day of Resurrection: The one who disobeys his parents, the woman who imitates men in her outward appearance, and the cuckold. And there are three who will not enter Paradise: The one who disobeys his parents, the drunkard, and the one who reminds people of what he has given them.&quot;</p>

<p>أَخْبَرَنَا عَمْرُو بْنُ عَلِيٍّ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنَا يَزِيدُ بْنُ زُرَيْعٍ، قَالَ حَدَّثَنَا عُمَرُ بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ، عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ يَسَارٍ، عَنْ سَالِمِ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ، عَنْ أَبِيهِ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏ &quot;‏ ثَلاَثَةٌ لاَ يَنْظُرُ اللَّهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِلَيْهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ الْعَاقُّ لِوَالِدَيْهِ وَالْمَرْأَةُ الْمُتَرَجِّلَةُ وَالدَّيُّوثُ وَثَلاَثَةٌ لاَ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ الْعَاقُّ لِوَالِدَيْهِ وَالْمُدْمِنُ عَلَى الْخَمْرِ وَالْمَنَّانُ بِمَا أَعْطَى ‏&quot;‏ ‏.‏</p>

<p>Grade : Hasan (Darussalam)</p>

<p>Reference : Sunan an-Nasa&#39;i 2562</p>

<p>The word Dayooth (الدَّيُّوثُ) == Cuckold.</p>

<p>cuckoldry is a major sin. The cuckold is the one who approves of evil conduct in his family.</p>

<p>Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about the one who came into his house and found a stranger with his wife, so he gave her her dues and divorced her by talaaq, then he went back and reconciled with her and heard that she had been found with a non-mahram man.</p>

<p>He replied: In the hadeeth from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) it says that when Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, created Paradise, He said: “By My glory and majesty, no miser, liar or cuckold will enter you.” The cuckold is the one who has no protective jealousy or pride. In al-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The believer has protective jealousy (gheerah) and Allah has protective jealousy, and the protective jealousy of Allah is that no slave should do that which is forbidden to him.” And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The adulterer — fornicator marries not but an adulteress — fornicatress or a Mushrikah; and the adulteress –fornicatress, none marries her except an adulterer — fornicater or a Mushrik [and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely, he is either an adulterer — fornicator, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer — fornicator, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress)]. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islâmic Monotheism)” [al-Noor 24:3]. The correct scholarly opinion is that it is not permissible to marry a zaaniyah (a woman who commits fornication or adultery) until after she has repented. The same applies if the wife commits zina: the husband has no right to keep her in that case; rather he should leave her, otherwise he will be a cuckold (duyooth). End quote from Majmoo‘ al-Fataawa, 32/141</p>

<p>The word dayooth (Cuckold or Cuck) is not a swear word or foul language. It is a type of disease that must be erradicated. Many of the problems facing our Ummah comes from the abundance of Cuckolds and a lack of real men.</p>

<p>This concludes my post</p>
