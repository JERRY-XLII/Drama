        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I woke up, I legit thought it was a real movie I saw some time ago but no, my brain gave me a mixture of Panic Room Them (Ils), Rosemary‚Äôs Baby and [REC] 2.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the movie was very dark, depressing, European and rainy. All the scenes were set at night. I was introduced to this couple who just moved into this townhouse like building. It had a giant elevator that even a car could fit into. What made this apartment unique was it had more floors underground and that‚Äôs where the couple moved in. They rented the ground floor, the first basement floor and the second one below it. They were planning to have a baby. The husband was getting friendly with the Indian neighbor family upstairs and the wife wasn‚Äôt very enthused about it.</p>

<p>The couple lived mostly on the first basement floor working on redecorating the other floors. In the kitchen room, there was a hole that was connected to  a drain cover. They were talking about fixing it. One very gritty European morning, a group of teens were smoking near that drain and talking. The wife could hear their conversation about how they should go into one of the apartments at night and have some fun. The wife alerted this to her husband but he had more of like a, ‚Äú<em>don‚Äôt worry about it</em>,‚Äù vibe. </p>

<p>The wife learned that she was pregnant and went out to buy a creepy old school looking stroller with embroidery cover and all. She took the big elevator because of it. It malfunctioned and took her to the floor of the Indian family upstairs. They were having some sort of party and invited her in. She saw her husband was already there. She stayed for a while but insisted she wasn‚Äôt feeling well and wanted to go back to her apartment. Her husband refused to join so she went alone.</p>

<p>When she got to her apartment, the electricity wasn‚Äôt working and there‚Äôs somebody in the kitchen. The teens had broken in and that‚Äôs when I got sleep paralysis and then woke up.</p>

<p>I would totally watch this movie but I ain‚Äôt giving the right away for this for free!!</p>
