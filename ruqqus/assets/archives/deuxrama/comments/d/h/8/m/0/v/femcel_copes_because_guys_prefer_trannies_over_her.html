    <div class="md"><p>It’s all about grindr, it makes it so easy. In Manhattan I’m centrally located so there’s always plenty of options within a 5 mile radius. I just filter for trans, send out nudes, and see who responds. You have to wade through prostitutes but as long as you’re hot and have quality nudes it’s still stupid easy and as a former nerd I’m a sucker for the attention and validation </p>

<p>Most of them just wanted to hookup, they had endless options and wanted to try new things too. I had some dates too though and I’m actually currently dating a post op girl I met from the app</p>

<p>To answer you more specifically, heterosexual men experience a wide range of what they find sexually attractive in women. Long hair, short hair, big, petite, whatever. It&#39;s not up to me to define what type of woman they find attractive!

<p>Also, &#39;transesses&#39; usually retain masculine features like narrow hips, wide shoulders, male gait due to being male, prominent facial features etc. Hence why things like vocal chord surgery, FFS, and shoulder reduction are sought ventures for those who wish to fully &#39;pass&#39;.</p>

<p>Like I&#39;ve been saying, though, heterosexuality is defined by opposite-sex attraction-- not all members of, but individuals of that you particularly find attractive from that group. Are you of the opinion that femininity-attracted in both sexes = heterosexual?</p>

<p>So if you would call a woman who&#39;s attracted to a buzz cut dyke heterosexual, you probably should extend the same courtesy to a male attracted to Blaire White, because aside from the genitals, the latter is more feminine (socially and physiologically) than the former.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you possess an X-Ray vision ability that allows you to be exclusively attracted to people having the SRY gene?</p>

<p>Listen, don&#39;t you see how retarded you sound doubling down on genes when you can&#39;t explain even the fact that most men are sexually attracted to stuff that doesn&#39;t include genitals because they are not allowed to see genitals before they get firmly sexually attracted and attached.</p>

<p>The correct response to tranny nonsense is &quot;I respect your brain&#39;s identification of you as a female, please respect my brain&#39;s identification of you as a male&quot;, not the opposite nonsense you&#39;re typing here.</p>

<p>Not the retarded retreat from &quot;women have cunts&quot; to &quot;women have XX chromosomes&quot; which you yourself recognized as retarded and denigrating since you felt the need to argue against my comment that started this shit.</p>

<p>Touched on before:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider that most transwomen don&#39;t pass and are easily clocked in person regardless. What you&#39;re describing is statistically rare to the point of negligence. But in the rare event that a heterosexual man is genuinely tricked and thus genuinely surprised to find out that a person has a penis, the attraction would dissolve upon realization. A bisexual man would continue forward.</p>

<p>As a heterosexual woman, this is how it goes for me. FTMs generally pass better than MTFs. But I&#39;m not attracted to vaginas nor phalloplasties.</p>

<p>Note though that you have a leg-up over lesbians, because they can&#39;t even claim that their attraction to other women is caused by the desire to get pregnant. In the lesbians&#39; case the whole thing is laid bare: we are adaptation-executors, not teleological optimizers. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t deny a lesbian&#39;s attraction to another woman on the grounds that she couldn&#39;t possibly have it because she can&#39;t impregnate the other woman&#39;s womb.</p>

<p>Similarly, you shouldn&#39;t reduce male sexuality to the teleological desire to have grandchildren.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not frustrated, but you keep thinking I&#39;m saying things that I&#39;m not. I never reduced any sexuality to teleological desire. What I have said is that opposite-<em>sex</em> attraction does not include male(sex)-male(sex) attraction. (I also said that opposite sex attraction does often, but not necessarily, include attraction to non-stereotypically-lusted-after biological traits rather than just the usual draws or even performative presentations i.e. perceived femininity).</p>

<p>How do you define sex and how do you justify your definition?</p>

<p>Before you seemed to use a teleological definition based on what&#39;s required to successfully reproduce, because naturalistic fallacy and stuff. I&#39;m pointing out that that excludes both trannies and lesbians.</p>
