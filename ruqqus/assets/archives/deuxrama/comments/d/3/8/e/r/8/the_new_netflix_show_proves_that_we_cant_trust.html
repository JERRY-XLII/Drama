        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SPOILERS!! Obviously ðŸ™„</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s this new Netflix show called the I-Land that is like fan fiction of Lost with a mediocre cast. The main difference is these people deserted on the island canâ€™t remember who they are. </p>

<p>Right out of the gate, two female leads woke up near each other without any memory and began being extremely bitchy towards each other. After that, mayo Chad claimed leadership and tried to rape the ethnically ambiguous looking female lead. He then tried gaslight her in front of others that sheâ€™s just a drama queen and making shit up. This is why we need to #BelieveWomen, folks!!!!</p>

<p>The female lead became like an outcast because everyone just followed Chad like idiots. The other bitchy female lead wanted to prove that Chad liked her more but she also got raped. Later she admitted that she hated women but couldnâ€™t hate men even though Chad raped her. Patriarchy in display, folks!!!!</p>

<p>The female lead quickly learned her lesson and switched her attention to Tyrone. Together, they found an abandoned resort hotel and ran back to tell the others. Now that sheâ€™s got the taste of BBC, she started to rub it in by showing Chad a bigger spear than the one he had and bragging about it. It wasnâ€™t subtle at all because she turned around and explained how she was making fun of Chadâ€™s small dick. Oh, boy! Chad got really riled up as long as his dick size was exposed. Mayo fragility on full display here, folks!!!! I </p>

<p>Only two episodes in and this show is already 10 out of 10.</p>
