    <div class="md"><p>they know retards only read headlines. look at the criteria.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shooting must <strong>involve at least one person being shot</strong> (not including the shooter).</p>

<p>The shooting must occur on school property, which includes but is not limited to buildings, <strong>athletic fields, parking lots, stadiums and buses.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We included accidental discharge of a firearm</strong> as long as the first two parameters are met, except in instances where the sole shooter is law enforcement or a security officer.</p>

<p><strong>We included injuries sustained from BB guns</strong>, since the Consumer Product Safety Commission has identified them as potentially lethal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>could only make it through so many bullshit examples before it was too stupid to continue. these are i think 12 out of the first 13 examples.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 19-year-old student was shot by a masked gunman while getting out of a car at Achievement Academy, a high school. His injuries were non-life-threatening. Authorities believe an altercation occurred between the victim and shooter.</p>

<p>A man was shot in the leg outside a dorm on the Langston University campus</p>

<p>A University of Central Missouri student was shot and killed after a gun was accidentally discharged in an on-campus apartment.</p>

<p>A 30-year-old student was shot in the chest and killed in a Texas State Technical College housing facility. Police believe the 20-year-old shooter and the victim were involved in a relationship dispute that turned into a physical fight.</p>

<p>A 22-year-old man was shot and killed outside an Austin Peay State University residence hall. Police believe the incident was a drug deal gone wrong.</p>

<p>A 38-year-old woman was shot during a nighttime gathering in the parking lot of Laurel Woods Elementary School, police say.</p>

<p>A 16-year old student was shot by another student outside Ridgway High School in what police believe to be a gang-related incident. The victim was taken to the hospital and later released.</p>

<p>in a Grambling State University assembly center. During an event, two men were involved in an altercation when one produced a gun and shot the other twice in the chest.</p>

<p>A 19-year-old student was shot in the abdomen and killed in a Tennessee State University dorm. The incident occurred after an 18-year-old classmate discharged a stolen gun he was playing with</p>

<p>After a football game at Rayne High School&#39;s stadium let out, multiple shots were fired into the parking lot</p>

<p>Two men entered the playground at Greenhalge Elementary School and shot indiscriminately at children with BB guns, hitting five children</p>

<p>A gun was discharged after school hours at Westbury High School, injuring one student.</p>
