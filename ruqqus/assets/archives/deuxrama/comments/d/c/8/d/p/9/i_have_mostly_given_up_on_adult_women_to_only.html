        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">12</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2019-10-02 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/LegitimateClassroom.html">LegitimateClassroom</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All I wanted from life was an adult woman who looks (but not necessarily acts, since that little thing is really weird) like a little girl. Below 5&#39;, slim, delicate, preferably Asian and with a kind personality shouldn&#39;t be that much to ask for. </p>

<p>Yet when I finally found her she suddenly decided to stop talking to me even though before we had been talking and writing regularly. I don&#39;t know why she&#39;d suddenly start ignoring me and not even read my messages; it&#39;s very hurtful to me. </p>

<p>Objectively speaking though she wasn&#39;t even that great. Her interests seemed very limited (and not in a good way) and I think she&#39;s actually not that smart for an Asian woman, for instance she failed the exam we wrote together while I got a 2.0 (average was like 3.4) which makes me believe she and her family probably must be pretty well off which again means they&#39;d probably want her to marry an even better off Chinese guy, meaning not me, as such I can conclude that our long term relationship success rate was basically 0 anyway. </p>

<p>However this and them only being here for a limited amount of time could generally prove to be a problem with the young Chinese women I happen to see around these parts. If their plan is to stay only temporarily until they get their degree how can I hope for one to become my future wife and the mother of our hapa children? </p>

<p>As such I think my focus on local Chinese women might be too limited and I should search further. In combination with our local age of consent only being fourteen I see this as a sign to also furthermore pursue local school girls just as nature and our national laws intended. </p>

<p>It is no secret to men that at least among white women teenage girls are the most desirable and as such an adult&#39;s woman attractiveness largely depends on how well she retains her prominent youthful features. Just compare <a href="https://i.imgur.com/jDvrKMJ.jpg">this picture which shows the average white teen girl</a> to this <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3rHH8yp.png">picture which is an estimation of how she looks a few years down the road</a>. </p>

<p>Thus I have decided to further expand my efforts and also aim to especially try picking up fresh teen girls from local anime conventions which are known for being a favorite among insecure angsty teen girls. </p>

<p>However I also shall pursue further efforts with tiny, local Asian women who look like little girls as I don&#39;t intend to give up on my dream of marrying a cute, legal loli Chinese woman. </p>

<p>But instead of just the looks I&#39;d also like for her to not be a retard who fails basic tests which really were just about basic calculations anyway.</p>

<p>Like a typical lazy silver spoon soyboy homosexual you’re not willing to put in the effort to create the woman that you desire. Like the daft creature you are, you neither realize the potential of these women nor are you willing to invest in it</p>

<p>Skinny? Check. A crack addiction will do that to her but it primes her as your ideal candidate. Lots of hobbies? Check. Interning as an actress for worldstar will give her so many engaging stories to keep you entertained</p>

<p>So she doesn’t have any teeth? You cheap faggot. Buy her veneers. So she is dependent on liquor and is on methadone? You uncreative queer. Lock her in your basement until she is detoxed. Worried about her etiquette? You timid fairy. Deter those bad habits using painful reinforcement with a switch. You can gleefully show your new project off to mom and dad at that fancy restaurant and they will be so proud of you!</p>
