<p>Nope. I welcome criticism of feminist activism. Without criticism, how would we improve?</p>

<p>Here is another question for you: Was Ida B Wells a suffragette?</p>

<p>White suffragettes aligned with white supremacist groups. Black suffragettes didn‚Äôt. You just erased their contributions. Ida B Wells‚Äô research into lynchings was invaluable in it‚Äôs time and is the backbone of any historical research into lynchings. </p>

<p>If OP had asked ‚Äúare women ever racist or violent?‚Äù I would have said yes (duh). But OP asked if feminist activism was embraced by society. The answer to that question is no (duh).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That pattern is consistent anywhere though... blacks always commit crime at higher levels anywhere in the world. Brazil, UK, France, Sweden, Germany, South Africa, Canada, etc. </p>

<p>Even after an estimated $5,000,000,000,000 transferred from whites to blacks in recent decades there are still so few examples of successful black communities anywhere in the world. If you‚Äôre telling me ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù is holding blacks back globally from forming safe and prosperous communities I‚Äôm saying maybe you‚Äôre right and whites are able to just completely dominate them in every way without even trying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i know ration and logic are another white mans tool to keep the blacks oppressed. But lets put that aside and use some. So if white men are the sole reason for tribal wars in africa all we need to do is look for places that never had white people and see if they also have tribal wars. So that means we cant count south africa or zimbabwe or congo. So lets look at rwanda. Which has never had white people and had the largest most brutal tribal war in recorded history. Can you tell me what white people had to do with that? Here you can read this article from the 80s but its obvious that the whites brought the modern world to africa with it a higher standard of living and industrialization and cities and modern infrastructure. This caused africans from all different tribes to live next to each other which caused conflicts that are even more rampant and violent now that the white people have left. Sounds like you want africans to abandon their tribal roots and join their nations drawn by their colonial masters. Sounds like your on the side of the whites.</p>

<p>Ah yes, feminist activism is clearly shunned by society, which is why the Women&#39;s March in 2017 was the largest single-day protest in US history, why many <a href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/mcs/media/images/78558000/jpg/_78558280_clegg_miliband_tshirt_624.jpg">major</a> <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/3169/3115868250_d2089f970a_b.jpg">politicians</a> have gone on record self-identifying as feminists and why communities and subreddits based around mens issues (r/misogyny, incels, theRedPill) are shunned/quarantined/banned and the female equivelents (r/misandry, trufemcels, redpillwomen) are not.</p>

<p>Clearly, society does not embrace feminism in the slightest /s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have really strong opinions on feminists, but don‚Äôt appear to be familiar with the actual theories or activism.</p>

<p>Believe women is not a slogan we apply to the law enforcement or the legal community. It‚Äôs what we say to the friends and family of survivors. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a particularly good slogan, but you are clearly misinterpreting it. </p>

<p>The two issues are somewhat connected in so far as <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2014/11/20/overlooking-rape">many police officer and departments </a> have adopted the belief that most reported sexual assaults are lies.</p>

<p>They neglect to investigate <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.buzzfeednews.com/amphtml/alexcampbell/unfounded">a large fraction</a> of reported sexual assaults, even when there is <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/false-rape-accusations-an-unbelievable-story">a great deal of evidence</a> that a crime was committed. </p>

<p>The belief that most women are lying about being assaulted is called a ‚Äúrape supportive belief‚Äù in the research. Not only do rape supportive beliefs help the community ignore sexual violence, they are also correlated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17709805/">perpetration of sexual violence.</a></p>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand how due process works, by assuming that someone who has been accused by your retarded movement that he&#39;s a rapist by default you already expose your complete lack of understanding or respect for it. Furthermore, the law won&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t change because the part that you nutjobs don&#39;t like, the innocent until proven guilty part is a fundamental part of every single democratic judicial system and for good reasons. Also police can&#39;t investigate crimes that aren&#39;t reported to it, and in the vast majority of these cases they weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Yours lustfully,</p>

<p>I agree which is why I would like police to investigate reported sexual assaults rather than assuming that accusers are guilty of lying.</p>

<p>Right. It was an example. As in one of many ways that feminists are working to strengthen due process.</p>

<p>However there is a pattern of police refusing to investigate reported assaults. In fact, Criminal Scientists estimate that 20% of police departments are burying reports of sexual violence based on inconsistencies in the data they report to the FBI.</p>

<p>Dude, have you considered reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve</a> instead of making shit up based on Alex Jones rants and glue-induced hallucinations?</p>

<p>For starters, the Fed belongs to the government and gives all its profit to the government (except for the dividends on the mandatory-owned stock by the 12 member banks), <em>&quot;In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2 billion and distributed $2.5 billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Second, the Fed doesn&#39;t own the money it loans to the government, nor do the twelve member banks, nor do any commercial banks. In the end, most of the US national debt is owed to the people who have savings accounts. I can&#39;t even begin to imagine who do you think this debt is owed to instead, and how exactly.</p>

<p>If all the bank loans were paid, no one could have a bank deposit, and there would not be a dollar of coin or currency in circulation. This is a staggering thought.

<p>So first we were all in debt to the Fed, now the poor Fed makes no profits :(</p>

<p>You should read the Wikipedia page about the Fed, the way the national debt works, etc, and make a chart of who owes whom, only then you can see who the debt is to and who gets the interest and so on. By the way, there&#39;s no &quot;the&quot; debt, household debt and national debt go in the opposite directions, so boomers get the interest on millennials&#39; mortgages, then it&#39;s millennials and zoomers and so on, and the system is stable.</p>

<p>If you want to understand complex topics a wiki will not do it. You will have a false understanding of something. Try this. 
<a href="https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0">https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0</a></p>

<p>But essentially to answer your question the fed is monetizing debt. Here it is from their own website explaining it for you. 
<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/spring-2013/is-the-fed-monetizing-government-debt">https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/spring-2013/is-the-fed-monetizing-government-debt</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Permanent ‚Äì If this accumulated Treasury debt is supposed to be permanent, then it is reasonable to expect that the corresponding supply of new money would also be permanent and would remain in the economy as either cash in circulation or bank reserves, Andolfatto and Li write. As the interest earned on the securities is remitted to the Treasury, the federal government essentially can borrow and spend this new money for free. Thus, under this scenario, money creation becomes a permanent source of financing for government spending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the bonds they bought and money they printed(qe) ie their balance sheet permanent? We are 10 years of them starting to increase their balance sheet and they tried for 2 years to reduce and had to reinflate it again in 2 weeks. Remember in 2008 the economy came to a halt when the senate agreed to let them print 700 billion they are now at 4 trillion. And the debt is permanent. Remember they issue bonds to the us. If they also have a balance then they are monetizing the debt allowing the government to have wild expenditures the private sector could never pay in taxes. The fed makes it disappear but that is the same thing venezuela did or zimbabwe or argentina. And this is global every central bank does it simultaneously. Thats why the dollar is becoming more and more worthless. In 1980s you could fill an entire grocery cart for $20. Its why we have a giant bloated government and why we have vast income inequality.</p>

<p>When pointed out that the Fed is in fact owned by the government and gives almost all of its profits back to the Treasury, suddenly</p>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This is clearly a product of false understanding, caused by listening to conspiratarded youtube videos that do nothing but appeal to emotion: woo, debt bad, this is debt, woo, that is debt, very bad, woo. And then you find yourself making completely inconsistent statements, saying that we all owe money to the Fed, then that the Fed is in debt, and you can&#39;t even say anything for yourself, you send me to watch a conspiratarded youtube video.</p>

<p>Instead of listening to woo videos that rely on tricking you emotionally, you can go and read Wikipedia that plainly states how things work, without any judgement. It&#39;s not really all that complicated:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security</a> is how the US government raises money needed to cover the budget deficit. This is a debt owed by the government to whoever bought the bonds, ultimately mostly to the people with savings accounts. The interest on this debt is paid to the boomers and will be paid to you when you retire, if you stop entertaining retarded theories and get your life in order.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#Discount_rate">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#Discount_rate</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#Repurchase_agreements">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve#Repurchase_agreements</a> is how the Fed squeezes money from commercial banks in need of liquidity by giving them short term loans.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization#Debt_monetization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization#Debt_monetization</a> is used to directly increase money supply. In this case the Fed injects money into the economy by purchasing the Treasury bonds; when they expire it gives the interest on them back to the Treasury and uses the principal to rebuy them.</p>

<p>As you can see, there&#39;s no place there for hairy bloodsucking spiders that everyone is indebted to and has to pay interest to and so on.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering if the capitalists buy most of the government&#39;s debt, then no, the interest rates on that are too low compared to stocks.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering how all that debt doesn&#39;t cause an interest death spiral, the key element is that it goes both ways, to put it simply: young people get in debt to old people to buy stuff like education or things necessary to start their business, then they repay that debt and start lending money to further young people, until they retire and slowly collect the debt. Also, the money created via &quot;monetizing debt&quot; is free of debt, because it&#39;s owed by the government to itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If they also have a balance then they are monetizing the debt allowing the government to have wild expenditures the private sector could never pay in taxes. The fed makes it disappear but that is the same thing venezuela did or zimbabwe or argentina. And this is global every central bank does it simultaneously. Thats why the dollar is becoming more and more worthless. In 1980s you could fill an entire grocery cart for $20.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The government has a target of 2% yearly inflation, purposefully. The purpose of inflation is to encourage people to invest (even by putting money into savings accounts), because then that money is lent to people who buy pizza ovens roughly speaking, and then when you collect your interest and collateral, there are extra pizzas in the world for you to buy with your money.</p>

<p>This is opposed to putting your money under the pillow and then suddenly causing bad inflation when there&#39;s not enough pizzas to match the amount of money in the economy, or the government printing more money than is necessary to meet the inflation target.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Fed routinely fails to meet the inflation target. From below, I mean. We don&#39;t have enough inflation. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tAThqgpJwSueqhvKM/frequently-asked-questions-for-central-banks-undershooting">Big Yud had a funny post about it</a>.

<p>Oh, this is a new argument, but for the love of G-d I can&#39;t understand wtf do you mean with it. What exactly does happen, in terms of the amounts of money on people&#39;s accounts and the goods in the world? Or should that phrase be understood in some magical negro way, like by destroying debt with voodoo pins the Fed puts a curse on the dollar?</p>

<p>spezedit: technically the debt is not destroyed, it&#39;s still owed by the Treasury to the Fed, but it&#39;s autorenewed and all interest goes back to the Treasury, so.</p>

<p>I welcome criticism of feminist activism. Without criticism, how would we improve?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My main criticism would be that many feminists reinforce patriarchal structures that benefit women. E.g. the assumption that men have agency and women don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Any time women do less well it&#39;s because society hates women, but any time men do less well it&#39;s assumed to be their fault for not pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.</p>

<p>Consider gendered products. More expensive item for women? It&#39;s the evil corporations charging women a pink tax because society hates women. More expensive item for men? Those stupid men must have fragile masculinity, need more bootstraps.</p>

<p>If you want to make a feminist mad all you have to do is flip the genders: say a more expensive item for men is actually a man tax, and that women choosing a more expensive item is evidence of fragile femininity. Show many feminists a gender flipped mirror and they see a misogynist. Which implies those feminists are misandrists.</p>

<p>How do feminists, and not women in general, reinforce the patriarchal structures that benefit us. I hear this a lot, that feminism is really just about women getting one over on men, but I don‚Äôt see it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More expensive item for men? Those stupid men must have fragile masculinity, need more bootstraps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a real example behind this or just something you made up?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>More expensive item for women? It&#39;s the evil corporations charging women a pink tax because society hates women.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, the reasoning here is that corporations correctly assume that women are willing to pay more for personal care products, because we experience so much pressure to look attractive and because the baseline for acceptable hygiene is so much higher for women than for men. Corporations exploit that to charge us more, and if we don‚Äôt name it, we will continue to be gauged.</p>

<p>Corporations may be evil, but not because of the pink tax.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any sector where men are gauged and women are not, but there are most certainly ways that corporations do men dirty. For instance how hygiene products are all covered in camo and shaped like grenades, because marketers are worried that straight men will think cleanliness is gay.</p>

<p>I would love to see men complain about that.</p>

<p>Search tumblr/twitter for &quot;fragile masculinity&quot; and most of it is &quot;marketers tried to upsell something to men&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Most men who don&#39;t like the grenade version just buy the cheaper gender neutral version instead of complaining about it.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re still assuming that if men don&#39;t want to smell like women it&#39;s because &quot;they&#39;re afraid of seeming gay&quot; but if women don&#39;t want to smell like men it&#39;s because &quot;men have bad hygiene&quot;. It could just as easily be framed that straight women are afraid of seeming butch and lesbian.</p>

<p>No. You said yourself that there are gender neutral products that don‚Äôt ‚Äúsmell like women‚Äù.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So? You keep thinking that if there is an equivalent issue for both men and women, it‚Äôs a gotcha, but both men and women are constrained by rigid and sometimes toxic gender norms. Both men and women need to break free of those rigid norms.</p>

<p>No one 100% satisfies the stereotypes for their gender. No one is 100% feminine in every way or masculine in every way. Some people are very aberrant.</p>

<p>The root of all toxic masculinity is a culture that punishes non-conformity even when conforming to gender norms is unhealthy for you or the people around you. For instance men who desperately need help but don‚Äôt want to ask because they will appear weak.</p>

<p>For instance: You‚Äôd think a woman dominant jury would be nice to a woman defendant but in practice they are strict. A male jury is much more likely to rule in a woman‚Äôs favor because lots of men see women as innocent children</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um, the football teams wearing pink was started by a football player who lost his mother and 4-5 of his aunts to breast cancer.  The question becomes, why don&#39;t any football players take the initiative to have the teams wear blue because his father died from prostate cancer?  So, then we see that the problem is that men don&#39;t care about men.  Same with the male prison population.  If a person cared enough to google, they&#39;d see that there are people trying to reduce the prison population who aren&#39;t focused on women.  <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/actions/">https://www.sentencingproject.org/actions/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, the thing is, it is just the guy&#39;s imagination.  I mean, isn&#39;t Movember for prostate cancer if you think football players wearing pink proves something?   And, I gave a link to an organization trying to reduce the prison population that needs people to help.  All the guys complaining about this stuff don&#39;t seem to be beguiled by the women are wonderful effect, that&#39;s for sure.  So, do something.  If you&#39;re angry enough to fume on ask feminists, you&#39;re mad enough to look for people helping men that could use some assistance from you.  If a retard like me can find these organizations, anyone can, even a moid.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to the idea of a men&#39;s rights movement that bases itself primarily on deconstructing harmful aspects of masculinity, and what it means to be men in the modern world; but that&#39;s not what I see in your communities - it&#39;s very hard to distinguish pro-male content from anti-female content in those communities.</p>

<p>Add to that the marked difference in quantity and quality of oppression towards men and women, and it&#39;s a little clearer. We have enough difficulty convincing people to take feminism seriously when women are much more clearly being fucked.</p>

<p>So first we were all in debt to the Fed, now the poor Fed makes no profits</p>

<p>If you want to understand complex topics a wiki will not do it. You will have a false understanding of something. Try this. 
<a href="https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0">https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0</a></p>

<p>But essentially to answer your question the fed is monetizing debt. Here it is from their own website explaining it for you. 
<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/spring-2013/is-the-fed-monetizing-government-debt">https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/spring-2013/is-the-fed-monetizing-government-debt</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Permanent ‚Äì If this accumulated Treasury debt is supposed to be permanent, then it is reasonable to expect that the corresponding supply of new money would also be permanent and would remain in the economy as either cash in circulation or bank reserves, Andolfatto and Li write. As the interest earned on the securities is remitted to the Treasury, the federal government essentially can borrow and spend this new money for free. Thus, under this scenario, money creation becomes a permanent source of financing for government spending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the bonds they bought and money they printed(qe) ie their balance sheet permanent? We are 10 years of them starting to increase their balance sheet and they tried for 2 years to reduce and had to reinflate it again in 2 weeks. Remember in 2008 the economy came to a halt when the senate agreed to let them print 700 billion they are now at 4 trillion. And the debt is permanent. Remember they issue bonds to the us. If they also have a balance then they are monetizing the debt allowing the government to have wild expenditures the private sector could never pay in taxes. The fed makes it disappear but that is the same thing venezuela did or zimbabwe or argentina. And this is global every central bank does it simultaneously. Thats why the dollar is becoming more and more worthless. In 1980s you could fill an entire grocery cart for $20. Its why we have a giant bloated government and why we have vast income inequality.</p>
