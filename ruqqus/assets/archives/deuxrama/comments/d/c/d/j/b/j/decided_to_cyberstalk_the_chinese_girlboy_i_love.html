        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Currently I&#39;m still trying to come to terms with the love of my life, a cute mini sized (4&#39;9&quot;) Chinese woman with the body of a little girl seemingly ignoring me for no reason. </p>

<p>Although I didn&#39;t sleep too well and cried a little I still had an enjoyable morning. I ate some chocolate ice cream and watched Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha (that&#39;s a Japanese cartoon about a little girl). Later I did some buttstuff, by which I mean mostly deadlifts and some accessory work for lower body. Even saw some petite school girls in tight clothes around so that wasn&#39;t too bad.</p>

<p>Still I keep wondering why the girl I loved, or was at least on a friendly basis with, would suddenly stop talking to me completely for seemingly no feasible reason ... as such I did what most men would do and decided to cyberstalk her.</p>

<p>Though the only thing I found was her facebook. I&#39;m 99% sure it&#39;s hers because the timeline seems about right and because of her profile picture. Though her picture is an old one from when she was like 8 or something but I can still tell by her face. So that&#39;s a bit weird, why not use a more recent picture? </p>

<p>Secondly I checked her info and under gender she picked &quot;male&quot; for some reason. Now I&#39;m wondering why. I have a few ideas and rated their likelihood:</p>

<ul>
<li>She picked the wrong option by accident</li>
</ul>

<p>Not impossible but I think she would have noticed</p>

<ul>
<li>She&#39;s actually a dude</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems unlikely considering she&#39;s like 4&#39;9&quot; and sounds like a girl, though she does have a bit of an androgynous face and bodytype ... </p>

<p>Also her name is one of those unisex names but it&#39;s mostly just used by guys so that&#39;s a bit weird. But still she&#39;s almost certainly a girl.</p>

<ul>
<li>She&#39;s lesbian or asexual (and probably infertile as women with her sort of built often are) and says so to keep guys away</li>
</ul>

<p>This seems the most likely and I have determined that she is indeed most likely ace and infertile and probably stopped talking to me because she knew I liked her and didn&#39;t want to hurt my feelings. </p>

<p>In combination with her picture I feel like she&#39;s a shy girl who wants to avoid male attention and is probably ace. </p>

<p>Still might send her a short message or so there next week just to see if she&#39;s really maliciously ignoring me ... had something I still wanted to ask her about anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds to me like you&#39;ve actually been pining over an underage Asian boy while thinking he&#39;s an adult woman who merely <em>looks</em> like an underage Asian boy. Did it never occur to you to grope her pussy and check for bussy? Rookie mistake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know it is weird because her name really is mostly a guy&#39;s name though I found a small number of women with it too. Her bodytype is a bit androgynous as well as her face but I&#39;m still pretty sure she&#39;s a woman. Also she&#39;s like 4&#39;9&quot;, guys aren&#39;t that short.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m quite certain she&#39;s in her 20s since she&#39;s doing a Master&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I can tell by emoji usage. Her emoji usage is that of an Asian girl&#39;s, I think. </p>

<p>She also sent me a picture of a cute paper frog she made which granted does seem a bit like something a kid might do but many adults enjoy papercrafts too.</p>

<p>And her laptop had stickers on it with Tigger and Winnie Pooh ... </p>

<p>I mean I thought she was just embracing her youthful side but what if she&#39;s actually some little kid prodigy. That would explain her being so extremely short even for a Chinese woman too ... although they can be very short</p>

<p>Then if I was into her that would be really pedo :s</p>
