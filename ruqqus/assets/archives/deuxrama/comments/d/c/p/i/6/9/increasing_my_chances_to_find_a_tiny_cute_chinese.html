        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Although the girl I thought who could be that person for me has now apparently been ignoring me (still waiting for her to write me back though) I still haven&#39;t given up on my dream of dating a cute, tiny Chinese woman. To increase my chances with this I&#39;ve compiled a few ideas first of all to get to know more of them but am also generally open to other ideas: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start learning Chinese so I can get to know some so I can help them with learning my language </p></li>
<li><p>Join some orgs/clubs which are more frequented by Chinese students </p></li>
<li><p>Start playing table tennis again. It&#39;s a popular sport with the Chinese </p></li>
<li><p>Make friends with more Chinese guys as they tend to know Chinese girls. Chinese guys often try to get into lifting because they want to get stronger to impress the Chinese girls so I could aim to find a couple Chinese workout partners </p></li>
<li><p>Just generally try talking to more Chinese girls and get to know them, whether as friends or a potential gf</p></li>
<li><p>Attend local culture exchange stuff </p></li>
<li><p>Take a Japanese class. From what I&#39;ve been told by a friend they are mostly visited by filthy weebs but also are somewhat popular with Chinese students </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thoughts? Other ideas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to be lean and muscular as long as you&#39;re muscular.  Most Chinese women can&#39;t tell the difference between the two.  Most are only used to fat, skinny, or skinny fat.</p>

<p>There are no businesses with a sign &quot;MASSAGE&quot; or &quot;MASSAGE SPA&quot;?</p>

<p>Maybe, but the qt tiny Chinese woman I liked also knew I was muscular and still she ignores me. Though I think it&#39;s probably because her boyfriend threatened her. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not American, I&#39;m European, and it would be good if she was early to mid 20s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, you&#39;re European.  They know better than to hook up with Euros unless they want a door mat.  The Filipinos or Indians might have be a better match for you. Since you&#39;re a Euro, a trip to Canada might be helpful for you.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;m not a doormat. Rude. Why would you think that? And I want a Chinese girlfriend, Korean would maybe be okay too, Japanese too but I never see any.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think China would still be better. The ratio of English speaking Chinese to white people would be way better. Also you can basically use HelloTalk as a hook up app so that makes it easy. </p>

<p>Also I&#39;m learning Chinese soon. </p>

<p>The good thing you have going for you in China is that most can&#39;t tell what&#39;s a good looking man by western standards and it helps the unattractive guys.  The same thing benefits the unattractive Chinese women as well.</p>

<p>Nice, finally ðŸ˜­</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just go there on vacation sometime after I&#39;m done with my postgrad degree. </p>

<p>In the meantime I&#39;ll try to get with the local ones and keep improving my physique ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª</p>

<p>I mean 100% of Chinese girls I asked for their number so far agreed to give me theirs so that&#39;s pretty damn good, no?</p>
