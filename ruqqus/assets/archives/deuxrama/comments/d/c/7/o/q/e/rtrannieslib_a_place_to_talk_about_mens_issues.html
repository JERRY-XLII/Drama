<p>Maybe it has to do with the fact that trans men aren’t so consistently retarded, this just might have to do with the fact that there’s a 2.2:1 ratio of mtfs to ftms, which just might have to do with the colossal amount of examples of fetish motivated, misdiagnosed, or self diagnosed mtfs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to observe the fetishism but I wouldn&#39;t say a 1:1 ratio is necessarily the actual ratio. Human psychology is weird...</p>

<p>What is true is how the most exceptional people like JY become the face of the movement. Hell, even Jenner was a creep. Remember how she was like &quot;omfg being a woman is so hard cuz clothes&quot;? </p>

<p>It&#39;s retarded that their antics help cultivate shitty views on trans people in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can’t just say _____ is weird to dismiss anything. </p>

<p>I don’t really care very much about JY, pervs existed before them and pervs will exist long after. I do care about mental health. I don’t want anyone to think that my criticism of the transgender community comes from hatred, but because there are people being misdiagnosed and drugs being misused. You wanna know who I do care about? People like James Schupe, who after renouncing his transgender identity, admitted to threatening doctors into giving him HRT and is now finding it harder to get treatment for obvious signs of psychosis than it was to transition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly enough, the cautionary tale has been told to me many times over. Not that much of it parallels with my or my peers&#39; experience.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one story of a sad little man called Walt Heyer, who had MPD but convinced (and was perhaps convinced by) clinicians he was trans while it was only delusion. He now writes for The Federalist, from a trans-critical point of view and seems to want to convince everyone that his experience is like everyone else&#39;s. </p>

<p>The annoying thing is that little amiss actually happens. People in my circles, despite the occasional snowflakeism, don&#39;t simply transition for the lulz, so I struggle to understand how the &quot;mental illness&quot; angle is any more applicable than Schupe&#39;s case, and many other anecdotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that the trans community often supports and shows the same fetishism, self diagnosis and self treatment that people like Schupe enacted, going so far as to disrupt scientific studies that don’t fit with the consensus. The demonization of “truscum” especially interesting when one notes how many of them on their subreddit avoid fetishizing themselves, avoid attention seeking with their identity, and have a near 1:1 ratio of FtMs to MtFs, in contrast to many other trans subreddits which indulge in the aforementioned traits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sold on the idea that 1:1 is the true ratio. Biological males and females turn out different, at least on the lowest levels. This is not to belittle the social role of one group or another, just that mentally they are indeed different and have different rates of specific mental illnesses. Nature isn&#39;t always symmetrical.</p>

<p>Still, I do agree that self-identity and diagnosis is a problem. Only if we were all honest about the desire to transition and had access to psychologists and psychiatrists who could help us through. That&#39;s not the case all the time unfortunately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interestingly enough, the cautionary tale has been told to me many times over. Not that much of it parallels with my or my peers&#39; experience.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one story of a sad little man called Walt Heyer, who had MPD but convinced (and was perhaps convinced by) clinicians he was trans while it was only delusion. He now writes for The Federalist, from a trans-critical point of view and seems to want to convince everyone that his experience is like everyone else&#39;s. </p>

<p>The annoying thing is that little amiss actually happens. People in my circles, despite the occasional snowflakeism, don&#39;t simply transition for the lulz, so I struggle to understand how the &quot;mental illness&quot; angle is any more applicable than Schupe&#39;s case, and many other anecdotes.</p>
