        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m big into video games and tabletop games. I run a biweekly Pathfinder game at my local gaming store. We play in a side room, but I&#39;m totally cool with people stopping in the doorway to watch us play and ask a couple questions as long as they&#39;re not disruptive. But I&#39;ve noticed that guys (it&#39;s always guys in my experience) are so disrespectful. 🙄</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had multiple instances of shopping around the gaming store where guys will <em>literally follow me around</em> the aisles. I will make laps around the store to see if they follow me back to the same one and yes, it happens. 😑</p>

<p>Guys will ask/insinuate I only play because my boyfriend got me into gaming. (not true and why is this a thing even if they did??) He got me into anal though 🤭</p>

<p>I am the DM. It&#39;s obvious I am the DM. Guys will watch us play and then ask the guys in my group if they can join us??? 😓</p>

<p>The most recent thing happened this weekend. I was invited to speak at a small local nerd con. I did a panel about running D&amp;D games for kids and the challenges you can face. Afterward, one of the guys from my panel caught me as I came out of the bathroom. He said I should call him if I ever wanted &quot;a more adult game&quot; (gross) and wrote his number on a card. I had no intention of calling him and stuck the card in my pocket and got out of there. 💨 </p>

<p>Up to this point, besides his gross &quot;adult game&quot; comment, I&#39;m not annoyed. You gotta shoot your shot, I understand that. But if they don&#39;t call you back, that&#39;s your answer. 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

<p>It turns out he and I work in the same agency, but different departments. Two days after I met him (and <strong>never called him</strong>) he <em>found my work email</em> and sent me a long email. The first paragraph was something vaguely work related so he could pretend the email was about work. And the following two paragraphs were about how hard it is to find a gaming group and then he caps it off with asking if he can join my game store group. 🤦🏻‍♀️</p>

<p>This is so inappropriate! Who thinks that if someone doesn&#39;t call you, that gives them license to stalk your work email and contact you? Has anyone else experienced anything like this/ What did you do? 🤔</p>
