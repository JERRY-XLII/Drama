<p>In my experience, this only ever happens with women who have already rejected you (or exes). If you&#39;ve been rejected, they know you were seriously interested. If not, why the hell should they put themselves out there when they&#39;re already feeling down - women are more afraid of rejection than most men, since they generally have less experience.</p>

<p>You act like you know a bit about economics.</p>

<p>You want to send cheap, ambiguous piss-weak signals, despite there being really no risk to yourself.</p>

<p>You want her to send a strong signal that she&#39;s OK with cheating on her boyfriend.</p>

<p>Why should that happen? Men always initiate, men are the ones who are expected to lead the dance. That&#39;s how it is. Maybe if you&#39;re really attractive a few women hit on you, but usually only in situations where it&#39;s unlikely to come back and cause issues if you reject them (e.g. at a club or something).</p>

<p>But I&#39;m open to evidence on the contrary, is your current system working?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either you&#39;re right, and she&#39;s waiting for you to show interest.</p>

<p>Or you&#39;ve misread the signals. Women can have weird logic behind their signals, and never learn how dumb their signals are because they don&#39;t face the harsh feedback of getting hard-rejected, instead they can just tell themselves fantasy stories about &quot;actually, he likes me and wants to meet up but other things are in the way and he is actually waiting for the perfect moment&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So my reasoning is: </p>

<p>If I initiate now there&#39;s two possibilities: </p>

<p>Either she&#39;s not into it and then it will be a bit awkward between us </p>

<p>Or she is into it </p>

<p>Then she either could cheat on the guy or she breaks up with him and gets with me. Both which would make me seem like a dick to others. And there&#39;s also the potential her boyfriend might stab me. </p>

<p>If I don&#39;t do anything now I can just stay friends with her for now but if they have a bad fight or break up I can be there for her and give it a shot. And in the meantime I can still see if I find someone else I like who treats her potential partner better than she does.</p>

<p>Chad here. I faked an entire life. I went to school, graduated top of my class, got a good degree and go to a job 40 hours a week and make a lot of money. I go to the gym. I bully weaker men. I am tough. I developed skills, practiced talking smoothly with women. I even optimized my dance moves at home when I am alone so I can rock in the club. Basically, my entire life is one elaborate ruse, just for one purpose: Fucking high quality women!</p>
