    <div class="md"><p>The entire left want to censor video games, social media, movies, and television, especially troids. Femininazis simply push for false rape accusations to be more acceptable, foids have been accusing men they didn&#39;t want people knowing they slept with or men they felt scorned by of rape for thousands of years. Society being toO gynocentric right now is a result of Neoliberalism and the internet.</p>

<p>Troids are pushing a sickness on our most young and vulnerable that causes them to doubt themselves, their masculinity/femininity, their own bodies, and cut themselves off from anybody that doesn&#39;t reaffirm them, before encouraging them to mutilate their own bodies, become social pariahs, and adopt an outward social identity that is wholley nonsensical. This produces chronically depressed individuals that are encouraged to face increasing levels of dysmorphia and to &quot;treat&quot; said dysmorphia by conforming to it maladaptively, as opposed to treating it like normal dysphoria, and rejecting it. Instead of encouraging people to be the best and happiest versions of itself, it encourages autistic kids to be the most sheltered, fragile, perverted, &quot;loud,&quot; and generally autistic versions of themselves. The whole &quot;egg&quot; meme culture is an abomination of postmodernism gone horribly wrong, that sees a man failing to live up to traditionally masculine traits not as a chance to improve or to accept one&#39;s self for being themselves, but rather engage in a community teaches them that they are both failures at being men, and are failures because based on literal nonsense, they just &quot;aren&#39;t male.&quot; You people are both victims and predators, and none of your ideaology makes any sense. </p>

<p>I have children on the way, and like every other generation in my father&#39;s line, they&#39;re probably going to be slightly autistic. This is the one topic I really don&#39;t LARP about, I had a strange childhood being raises by a man with the social skills of a 15 year old going through their edgy phase. I don&#39;t know how to protect them from an internet that really will likely try to convince them that their inability to fit in with their peers is actually an underlying issue with their body that can be &quot;solved&quot; by walking down a path I&#39;ve only seen bring people misery and lies of happiness. I&#39;m sure in 20 years or so this shit will be a distant memory, and people will have forgotten, or rejected our contemporary gender theory.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have time for that.</p>

<p>You people are misled, I feel bad for you, but If have you all removed from society entirely if I had the chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I&#39;m pretty much doing what you suggest - trying to man the fuck up and stop wanting to be a girl. I meme about transitioning but tbh I&#39;m still hoping it will all go away and I can just be happy with my body as it is. But I&#39;ve been struggling with this since I was like 10, so that probably won&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>The whole &quot;egg&quot; thing is a complete joke, I seriously doubt it influences anyone. We don&#39;t need any external motivation to transition - we&#39;re fighting against our desire to transition as hard as possible, but lots of people give in. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s why I&#39;m stockpiling ammo. Just try it, faggot. </p>

<p>And I sincerely hope your kid turns out to be a troid. I&#39;m betting one of them will. I come from a line of autistic males as well.</p>

<p>The jokes people tell speak so much more about themselves than they think. I doubt most people go uninfluenced by being part of &quot;egg&quot; jokes, primarily because of how autistic and insane you have to be to even find them coherent, let alone logical. They also really make my skin crawl.</p>

<p>the vast majority of us think the egg stuff is stupid. It&#39;s mostly people larping about how they want to be forced to transition as a way of abdicating responsibility for the decision. Nobody actually goes to egg_irl thinking they&#39;re fine with being a man, and then decides they want to be female. In order to be aware of that sub you have to be pretty deep in trannny shit already</p>
