<p>I swear, people seem to take the other side&#39;s arguments and flip them (to show the inconsistency and hypocrisy) so often they seem to just adopt them.  Pointing out hypocrisy is like being sarcastic - you can confuse a lot of stupid people.</p>

For hobbies I write, I draw, I compose, I sculpt, I do photography, I do astrophotography &amp; I cook. I already have a gym schedule but thanks for the suggestion.</p>

<p>Did I mention I do all of that while having CRPS, Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Sclerosis, Polymyositis, Interstitial Cystitis &amp; Long QT Syndrome?</p>

<p>Not to come out of left field but I believe the phenomena of these individuals becoming more common (not to mention radicalized) is a relevant social issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was asked if I’d considered taking up a hobby &amp; it was suggested there was some sort of “void” in my life. I answered the question &amp; addressed the assumption. That ought to be very straightforward to anyone who is literate. If you couldn’t exercise the wherewithal to read the conversation thread that’s really not my problem.</p>

<p>You know I’ve never encountered an accomplished person who called education &amp; service to their fellow man arbitrary or anything of the like? It also doesn’t fool me that all you were able to come up with in response to what I do with my life was some hyperbolic imitation of what I shared. If you weren’t frittering your existence away you would have said so but you didn’t.</p>

<p>I actually didn’t list anything that could be considered a qualification. I didn’t claim to already be a doctor or a professional advocate or anything of the sort. I only stated the labors &amp; interests with which I fill my time. So what exactly is my big elaborate lie here? That I go to school? That I make calls &amp; write letters &amp; protest for human rights? Did you put any effort into making the words you typed have any semblance of a relationship to what I wrote or was that too much work for you as well?</p>

<p>I’m curious, what did you imagine would happen when you decided name calling was the right move here? That you would feel better? That you would hurt my feelings? That I wouldn’t notice your straw man? That you wouldn’t come off as too triggered to come up with a halfway decent insult?</p>

<p>Here’s a link to what a Straw Man is so I don’t have to listen to you get it wrong: [Straw Man Fallacy]</p>

<p>Btw dull &amp; stupid are redundant, that means they mean the same thing therefore including both is unnecessary. That’s something you want to avoid if you’d like for others to take you seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, those words may or may not mean the same thing &amp; so that is defined by context. In the context of attempting to call someone stupid “dull” is synonymous. If you’re going to be pedantic at least take all the technicalities into account.</p>

<p>So summarily your new argument to disagree with my assertion you’re lazy is to whine &amp; complain about how it’s too hard to read four short paragraphs &amp; two sentences?</p>

<p>I don’t really know what to say to you if you’re the kind of person who believes it’s a incredibly high effort task to type out fewer than 350 words on any given topic. Have you tried Hooked on Phonics? It’s supposed to be very helpful for people who cannot yet read or write.</p>
