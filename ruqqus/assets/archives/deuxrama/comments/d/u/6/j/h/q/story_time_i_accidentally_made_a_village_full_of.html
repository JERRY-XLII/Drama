        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Banished</strong> is one of my favorite games of all time. Period! It‚Äôs a little medieval-esque city builder. Quite challenging to newcomers but I am very good at it üíÖüèª</p>

<p>First of all, look how cute my village is with waterwheels ü•∞</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/rdVaPd6.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/rdVaPd6.jpg</a></p>

<p>Anyway, this game lets you start off with people who were banished (get it?) from their previous town and makes you start a new village with them. Winters are harsh and most players are scared to start farming until they are stable in mid game. But not me! I farm immediately because I‚Äôm really good at this game üíÖüèª</p>

<p>The toughest part is to balance the population and the food production. The villagers you get initially are mostly adults and they will all die out around the same time when the second generation enters into adulthood. That‚Äôs when most newcomers screw themselves over. By the time the first generation starts dying, they don‚Äôt have enough people in the second generation to continue on. </p>

<p>For people to possibly start having kids, you need to build a house for a male and a female to stay in. Most players would try to fix the population shortage problem by putting down a lot of houses immediately in the beginning of the game to make sure they would have enough population when the first generation died out. But here‚Äôs the catch, each house requires a significant number of food and firewood. People in this game are really selfish. They would hog all the resources in their home and this results in resources shortage and people would start dying.</p>

<p>As I have mastered this game üíÖüèª and I start farming immediately in the first year, I don‚Äôt ever have food shortage but the game did a weird thing the last time I played it. Almost all the babies born in the second generation were boys. This resulted in a bunch of incels</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/cqEnvRt/">https://imgur.com/a/cqEnvRt/</a></p>

<p>They occupied a whole house and were unproductive as hell to the society üôÑ</p>

<p>I had to build more houses in hopes of people boning. Luckily, the third generation produced by a few second generation couples had a lot of girls. This is when the game decided to pair up more couples. All the incel pedos from the second generation snatched up baby girls!!</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ECInKnE/">https://imgur.com/a/ECInKnE/</a></p>

<p>One guy lived together with  1 year old girl!! WTF, game? When the girls reached like 12-14, they would start getting pregnant. Now my village population is booming with like 8 children at a time. I also accepted some immigrants who got laid immediately. I bet that pissed off the local incels.</p>

<p>One female teacher went against the grain and slept with a young male student!</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/beRZSNR.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/beRZSNR.jpg</a></p>

<p>I feel like this is getting too realistic!</p>

<p>Banished is one of my favorite games of all time.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/hIulM1p.png">Actual footage of me when someone says that</a>.  But the more I think about it, it makes perfect sense that you would love it.  Your village and the countryside look spectacular and the change of seasons is beautiful.  The simulation behind everything is quite rudimentary though.  But women, especially asian women, are superficial, so I guess it&#39;s the perfect game for you.  ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠</p>

<p>As I have mastered this game üíÖüèª</p>

<p>I never did because I was too busy playing better games that require my giant XY brain, so... congratulations... I guess? üôÑ</p>

<p>I do have to say though that this phenomenon you&#39;ve pointed out in Banished is interesting.  In RimWorld, you have the same kind of problems where there&#39;s a very small population so for example if someone is gay, it&#39;s very likely that they&#39;ll be alone forever.  But there are no kids in that game so they dodge the issue of how this stuff plays out over multiple generations.  Tropico (I mean 2D boomer Tropico, not whatever Eurotrash abomination they&#39;re pumping out now) dealt with this in I think the best way, where you have a population of 50+ so sooner or later the incel is gonna find a spouse.</p>

<p>Have you actually played any of these... you know... games for boys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rimworld has a huge learning curve. Too many things going on. I don‚Äôt want to spend too much time just learning how to put in refrigerators! And cannibalism is eww! Banished is beautiful, peaceful and incestuous. On the other hand, Tropico is too easy! </p>

<p>It&#39;s worth it.  Shut up and take the Rimworld pill.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you gotta play the original.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re on a treadmill, constantly struggling to lift your people out of poverty fast enough that they don&#39;t get impatient and overthrow you.  The sequels took out all the challenge.</p>
