        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/online-backlash-against-don-cherry-for-comments-on-immigrants-and-remembrance-day#comments-area">https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/online-backlash-against-don-cherry-for-comments-on-immigrants-and-remembrance-day#comments-area</a></p>

<p>So The thing about Don Cherry, with all due respect, is he is unironically the most senile person ive seen on tv. He is literally an ancient relic at this point. He got himself into a kerfuffle recently &quot;The 85-year-old Cherry said on Saturday on his weekly Coach’s Corner segment as part of Hockey Night in Canada that he’s less frequently seeing people wearing poppies anymore to honour fallen Canadian soldiers — and he singled out those he believes are immigrants in Toronto, prompting a swift online backlash.&quot;</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>So I was reading the most liked comments on this moderate website, and wow are they racist. There are about 1400 comments, every single one of the most liked were in support of Don. This is kind of concerning to me as it confirms my suspicions that multiculturalism will fail, and we will unironically continue to see political violence, and maybe a new hitler. Especially comments such as</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Haas  </p>

<p>The most nauseating thing this days, ethnic and religious extremist Sikhs are hanging around and giving advice what is racist, what is not racist. If it is acceptable, people with SS uniforms should hang around and also give advice what is racist and what is not racist.                             </p>

<p>As you wear your poppy to commemorate the loss of those soldiers lives, also reflect that they also fought on the wrong side, and their losses were in vain.   </p>

<p>Now we are occupied by foreigners calling us racist. </p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.</p>

<p>Bull. Shit. How much peace have we brought to the middle east? At what civilian cost of life?</p>

<p>Humanitarian assistance: helping those most affected: In 2019, Canada announced the two-year renewal of the Middle East Strategy. We have committed up to $1.4 billion over five years (2016-2021) to provide gender-responsive humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable conflict-affected populations in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan.   </p>

<p>Development assistance: building resilience  </p>

<p>Canada’s development assistance is providing longer-term support to build the capacity of governments, communities, and households in Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon. In Syria, our programming targets community-level projects focusing on women’s empowerment. These efforts across the region are helping communities withstand and recover from the shocks and stresses caused by the crises.  </p>

<p>Empowering women and girls and advancing gender equality  </p>

<p>Women and girls in the Middle East are generally more disadvantaged compared to those in other middle-income countries. Conflicts in Iraq and Syria have diminished the meaningful participation of women in all spheres and have intensified gender-based violence. Empowering women and girls and advancing gender equality is the core of our development assistance. This is instrumental to achieving more inclusive institutions and longer-term stability.  </p>

<p>Diplomatic engagement  </p>

<p>Canadian diplomats at our bilateral and multilateral missions work with partners and allies to achieve sustainable solutions to the ongoing crises in Iraq and Syria, and their impact on the region, particularly in Jordan and Lebanon. They advocate for human rights as well as economic, social, and political reforms. They also promote Canadian values such as gender equality and pluralism, and reinforce a rules-based international order.  </p>

<p>Diplomats assess and track the evolving situation in the region to ensure an appropriate Canadian response and that our  actions are coordinated with a wide range of partners. </p>
