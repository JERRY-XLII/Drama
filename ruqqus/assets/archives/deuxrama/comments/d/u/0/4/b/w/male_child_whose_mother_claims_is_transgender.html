    <div class="md"><p>No, she did not make this decision on her own.  Luna received medical advice from both therapists and pediatricians, who after extensive analysis of her condition, decided it would be best for her to have the option to socially transition while a child.  No surgeries will be performed on her for her condition until adulthood, at her own discretion.  Pediatricians and therapists will absolutely not put children under the knife for sexual transition operations.  At most, they will prescribe them reversible hormonal blockers when they are around 9-12ish years old or depending on the age that they begin to enter puberty.  HRT is not even started until years after that and after more extensive therapy.</p>

<p>Theres nothing reversable about stunted development you fucking autistic child predator. You fucking degenerates will be put to the wall sooner than you think. There&#39;s no such thing as transgenderism, there is autistic children being failed by the system and convinced of something that is purely absurd, amd alloeed to indulge in delusioms perpetuated by child rapists, and other predators who wish to surround themselves with mentally unstable children who&#39;ve they have totally and utterly ruined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go to the sources which I provided, which include an account of the actual court documents themselves.  It is already well-documented in the courts that the therapists that Luna went to officially diagnosed her with gender dysphoria and recommended social transitioning as a treatment, if Luna wanted it.  Also, there is no evidence that suggests that am individual with gender dysphoria is inherently autistic.  If you are going to make that claim, then please provide some evidence to support your citation.  If you would like, I have plenty of my own citations on the topic of transgenderism which both prove its existence and prove that transitioning is the most efficient (and only) treatment for gender dysphoria.  Just let me know if you want those citations, and I will provide them at will.  Also, FYI, telling people to kill themselves, calling them autistic predators, etc is against the Reddit terms of service.  I would advise you to revisit those for future reference.</p>

<p>You certainly are, so are 90% of you, there&#39;s no study. There doesn&#39;t need to be. </p>

<p>Therapists are instructed to diagnose any child who says certain things as transgender. Doesn&#39;t fucking mean the kid wasn&#39;t influenced. Or that you know, transgenderism is a literal thing that exists or transitioning a child is ever going to beneficial to their health. Give me all your fucking pseudobablle sources, I&#39;ve seen them all, and they&#39;re all flimsy bullshit because it&#39;s fundamentally impossible to separate the psychologically influenced and organic in current philosophy. There no physical markers, and virtually nobody without prior exposure to transgender ever expresses thoughts of transgenderism.</p>

<p>You filthy degenerates are all just former victims, that go around your fucking shitty forums and even the real world telling people who are mildly autistic, don&#39;t fit in, are unhappy, or are somehow not fully masculine(or feminine) that the answer to their problems lies in transgenderism. You&#39;re all so fucking predatory it disgusts me. Personally I don&#39;t know why the fuck every medical Association bows to you, but they shouldn&#39;t be. Your people won&#39;t be this prevalent in 30 years, and it won&#39;t be long before society at large sees you for the predators you truly are. Trans panic and &quot;trans people dying every day&quot; are more of your tribes made up phenomena that the media peddles, but one day they may very well become reality. I&#39;d worry about keeping my future kids safe from you fucking rapists, but I really dont see society putting up with your bullshit much longer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Being trans is not classified as a mental illness:</strong></p>

<p>Being trans is not classified as a mental illness by either the <a href="http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx"><strong>American Psychological Association</strong></a> or the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/20/transgender-not-mental-illness-world-health-organization/717758002/"><strong>World Health Organization</strong></a>. Gender dysphoria or incongruence is recognized by both as a medical condition, and transition is the only treatment recognized as effective and appropriate medical response to this condition. A trans person who has completed transition, and who no longer experiences distress because the conditions previously causing it have been corrected, is no longer diagnosed as having dypshoria or incongruence.</p>

<p><strong>On claims that the &quot;Swedish Study&quot; shows that transition does not reduce suicide risk:</strong></p>

<p>That is a reference to <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016885"><strong>this study</strong></a> by Dr. Dhejne. The claim that her study shows that transition does not reduce risk of suicide attempts while improving mental health and quality of life is a deliberate misrepresentation popularized by Paul McHugh, a religious extremist and <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/hate-group-masquerading-as-pediatricians-attacks-transgender-youth-544e755c6a20"><strong>leading member</strong></a> of an anti-gay and anti-trans <a href="http://www.snopes.com/americas-pediatricians-gender-kids/"><strong>hate group</strong></a>, who presents himself as a reputable source but publishes work without peer review. His claim to fame is having shut down the Johns Hopkins trans health program in the 70&#39;s, which he did not based on medical evidence but on his personal ideological opposition to transition. Johns Hopkins has <a href="http://transadvocate.com/johns-hopkins-resumes-trans-care_n_19077.htm"><strong>resumed offering transition related medical care</strong></a>, including reconstructive surgery, and their faculty are finally <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/oped/bs-ed-lgbtq-hopkins-20160928-story.html"><strong>disavowing</strong></a> him for his irresponsible and ideologically motivated misrepresentation of the current science of sex and gender.</p>

<p>That study&#39;s lead author Dr. Dhejne had <a href="http://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm"><strong>emphatically denounced</strong></a> McHugh and his misuse of her work. If for those who don&#39;t trust the TransAdvocate article, she did so again in her <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/"><strong>r/Science AMA last year</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Details on Dr. Dhejne&#39;s often misrepresented study - it found only that trans people who transitioned <em>prior to 1989</em>had slightly higher risk of suicide attempts than the <em>general public.</em> The author attributed this higher risk to the vicious anti-trans discrimination people who transitioned 29+ years ago experienced. The study found no difference in the risk of suicide attempts among trans people who transitioned after 1989, vs the general public.</p>

<p>She is also the primary author the other study I posted below, <em>An analysis of all applications for sex reassignment surgery in Sweden, 1960-2010: prevalence, incidence, and regrets</em>, which found a &quot;regret&quot; rate of 2.2%</p>

You might find yourself loving someone like Ben Shapiro or Dennis Prager, since they are pretty well known for their emotional persuasion.  I am sure it would be inspirational for you.  But I am glad to provide some sources, since you asked.  I shall leave them down below, and I will quote them as they are from the author who so kindly organized them.  Unfortunately, they are quite long, so I will have to post them in several comments.  Here we go:</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>&quot; <strong>For when people try to claim puberty blockers are harmful:</strong></p>

<p>There is <em>extensive</em> research about long term use of puberty blockers, and they have overwhelmingly been shown to be very gentle and safe.</p>

<p>This treatment isn&#39;t just used for trans youth - it has been the standard treatment for kids with precocious puberty for decades. Most kids with precocious puberty don&#39;t have any underlying medical condition, their early development is just an extreme variation of normal development, but it would still cause serious psychological damage to start puberty at the age of, say, 6. This treatment has no long term side effects; it just puts puberty on hold. Stop treatment, and puberty picks up where it left off.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>And for the</strong> <strong><em>lots of people regret transition</em></strong> <strong>bullshit:</strong></p>

<p>This 1% &quot;regret&quot; rate also includes a lot of people who are very happy they transitioned, and continue to live as a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth, but regret that medical error or shitty luck led to low quality surgical results.</p>

<p>This is a risk in any reconstructive surgery, and a success rate of about 99% is astonishingly good for any medical treatment. And &quot;regret&quot; rates have been going down for decades, as surgical methods improve.</p>

The most comprehensive meta-review done to date analyzed 74 follow-up studies and 8 reviews of outcome studies published between 1961 and 1991 (1000-1600 MTF and 400-550 FTM patients). The authors concluded that in this 30 year period, &lt;1% of female-to-males (FTMs) and 1-1.5% of male-to-females (MTFs) experienced persistent regret following SRS. Studies published since 1991 have reported a decrease in the incidence of regret for both MTFs and FTMs that is likely due to improved quality of psychological and surgical care for individuals undergoing sex reassignment.</em></li>

<p>And while until recently there has been no place in modern US/European culture for people with gender identities and lives atypical to their sex at birth to exist publicly, that isn&#39;t true in other times and cultures. Throughout the middle east and Asia there have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_%28South_Asia%29"><strong>Hijra</strong></a> visible in public life for hundreds or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_%28South_Asia%29#Hijras_in_the_Mahabharata"><strong>thousands</strong></a> of years. The same is true of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey"><strong>Kathoey</strong></a> in Thailand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxe"><strong>Muxe</strong></a> in Zapotec culture in Mexico, various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit"><strong>two-spirit</strong></a> identities found in indigenous American cultures, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81h%C5%AB"><strong>Māhū</strong></a> in traditional Hawaiian/Tahitian/Maohi cultures, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%27afafine"><strong>Fa&#39;afafine</strong></a> of Samoa, Tongan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakaleiti"><strong>Fakaleiti</strong></a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_sworn_virgins"><strong>Sworn Virgins</strong></a> of the Balkans, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galli"><strong>Galli</strong></a> of Ancient Rome, etc.</p>

<p>And of course, humans are not the only animals. While we can&#39;t interview animals, and gender identity is harder to identify visually in animals than something like same-gender sexual activity is, we sure as hell have observed a lot of animals displaying <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/july13/flygene-071305.html"><strong>instinctive behavior typically associated with the other sex</strong></a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Why not?  All scientific evidence suggests that gender transitions for gender dysphoria improve life quality and reduce the dysphoria in the vast majority of cases.  Are you admitting that you are more interested in forcing a child to suffer from anguish, simply because it does not fit your political or religious narrative, despite those narratives being objectively falsified by the scientific and medical communities?  Also, you seem awfully obsessed with the topic of pedophilia.  I do not suppose you would be projecting?  Statistically, Christian priests have higher rates of predatory behavior than transgender individuals ever have.</p>

You people live between a delusional, made up self affirming presentation of happiness and become immediately suicide when you realize what you&#39;ve done. When you kill yourselves you claim it&#39;s because you didn&#39;t get to transition enough or because people are to mean, and when you present as happy the idea you&#39;re lying to yourself is simply preposterous.

<p>A source. I need a source.</p>

<p>Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.</p>

<p>No, you can&#39;t make inferences and observations from the sources you&#39;ve gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you&#39;ve gathered.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t make normative statements from empirical evidence.</p>

<p>Do you have a degree in that field?</p>

<p>A college degree? In that field?</p>

<p>Then your arguments are invalid.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.</p>

<p>Correlation does not equal causation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, all 308 pages of user history.  Are you really that in love?  What an honor that I have a new fan.  Maybe you should follow my page, since you seem to really enjoy it.  Hey, buddy.  I can cite my own sources on the topic, and I gladly will.  In fact, someone has already compiled it for this very topic, and you can access the list through one link.  Peer-reviewed scholarly studies, medical journals, etc -- you name it.  Just follow the link at the bottom of the comment, and you will find all the sources neatly organized.  </p>

<p>But come now, surely you have better than empty insults, right?  You are not making any claims, which does not seem to get us anywhere, now does it?  Also, do you have a college degree in that field?  If not, then by your own logic, your own arguments are invalid.  So then why are you trying to legislate those opinions?  Seems a bit silly.  Seriously though, just tell me if you ever need help in your own transition, if it ever turns out that you feel that way yourself.  I would not want to leave someone who is in need hanging.</p>

If you cannot even educate yourself on the basics of biology, then are you going to go around attempting to deny all biological science while completely ignoring all research into the field?  Why should it be any different for other topics within science?  I can provide you the data, but I cannot force you to read it.  My point is, if you are going to try to lecture other people on the topic, then at least have a remotely decent understanding of said topic.  At least attempt to provide data of your own, or at least address any of the data provided which counters your points.</p>
