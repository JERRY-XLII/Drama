<p>The most incriminating</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doesn&#39;t seem like understanding of comedy to be honest, if it was against black people they wouldn&#39;t be the only reasonable and level headed characters in the sketch </p>

<p>It&#39;s taking the piss out of racist people who think they aren&#39;t because they have black friends</p>

<p>Find me one comic of any race other than white that doesn&#39;t use race in their act, attacking a sketch making fun of white people&#39;s ignorance because it&#39;s white people talking about race is hypocritical</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red-pilled on Der Coomer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sketch also makes out the white people to be ignorant  idiots </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Insane and unconvincing transgender Emily Howard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the only one we can make a case for because it clearly shows the trans person as the target of ridicule </p>

<p>People have been attacking comedy flippantly for years and it will get laughed out because it&#39;s a coward move to attack a comedian who lazily exaggerates for the clear purpose of a joke, rather than take on more serious instances of it actual racist abuse that is harder to take down, if you&#39;re gonna waste your time going after a comedy show years after it comes out, at least make an actual effort</p>

<p>The sketch takes the piss out of these people... Who you&#39;re now also taking the piss out of, so you just agreed with accidentally agreed with little Britain while trying to attack little Britain??</p>

<p>Whatever trevor if you wanna help racism do something actually meaningful because complaining about how old comedy may/may not be interpreted is so soft you could be on a toilet paper ad... And ironically exactly what a &quot;white liberal&quot; would do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got to agree with the ‘most incriminating’ I thought it was absolutely ripping it out of white people who try to fit in with black people.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this behaviour first hand and it is cringe. </p>

<p>In my group of friends a handful of them are black, we all hang around in combinations of the same group of people. This brings us into association with other groups of people who are on the outer circle of friends you could say.</p>

<p>In my area there honestly isn’t many black people about on the drinking scene. Here’s a few examples of some of the cringiest shit these idiot outer circle people do to ‘accommodate’ these black people.</p>

<p>One over the course of an evening kept referring to my best friend as ‘nigger’ like he had just watched don’t be a menace. It was awkward as fuck and after an hour or so  my mate ended up threatening to beat him up.</p>

<p>We were all drinking cans of red stripe and another outer circle instead of just handing a beer to my friend had to for some reason mention that he doesn’t have any Hennessy for him to drink unfortunately he’s just run out. It came out of no where and was just fucking silly. </p>

<p>I came into a party full of very what we’d call politically correct people, very liberal. I came with my best mate who’s black and two of his friends also black who i knew but not very well. I swear to god one of them sees them sitting down on the sofa and says ‘ah I see the brothers have arrived’ everyone went quiet and upon realising how awkward it was starring apologising profusely. Because of the combination of cocaine and alcohol then ends up crying at how racist that was. Making a big scene when everyone was over it lol.</p>

<p>There’s more but the little Britain thing just made me laugh more than anything.</p>

<p>You can ban it if you want, but that only means the people who want it will get it by pirating it. It&#39;s pretty pointless, and erasing history is an ass-backwards way of making progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re not erasing history though. It’s not like they’re burning every trace. HBO removed it, Netflix removes shows all the time yet it’s not “removing history” because you can buy it or pirate it. </p>

<p>Humor is subjective but when you’re humor is just making fun of transgender people the way they did and cranking a stereotype to 11 is really unfunny. Those seem to be the problematic episodes and even the creator had problems of how they portrayed mentally handicapped (never seen an episode) or how he treated transgender people. Idk why they removed the whole series.</p>

<p>How exactly is doing shit like this going to help anything? How is removing access to a hilarious comedy tv series just because it has “blackface” going to make anyone take the BLM movement more seriously? Because I can guarantee that all it’ll do is piss people off. </p>

<p>Oh wait, of course, I forgot. The people making these decisions can neither understand comedy, nor do they have any backbone, nor any semblance of common sense. They’re cowardly, stupid and this is downright pathetic.</p>
