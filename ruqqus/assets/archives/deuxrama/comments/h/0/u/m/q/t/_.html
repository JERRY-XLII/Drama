    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sure, why not. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve worked fairly extensively in Africa. South Africa, Angola, Namibia and Botswana. Botswana is nice actually, Namibia is not so bad.</p>

<p>South Africa, out side of central Cape Town, is completely lawless. It‚Äôs advisable to be armed. Angola is pure hell. Never again. Lawless, corrupt, rampant racially aggravated crime, and a population that is permanently drunk out of their minds. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve worked in Eq. Guinea which is just a strange place. Heavily influenced by the USSR I was told. A population which is simultaneously outrageously corrupt - you have to bribe your way in and out of the country - and almost childishly simple. I was treated with real fascination out there, like they‚Äôd never seen a white man before, which to be fair they actually hadn‚Äôt in a couple of cases. The people were nice enough tbf. </p>

<p>Ivory Coast is a dump. Again corrupt as hell, the population seem restively violent and are armed to the teeth, and you can‚Äôt travel more than ten miles without having to bribe your way through a ‚Äútoll booth‚Äù.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm fairly certain Lagos is hell. Just a massive, densely populated shanty town. Random as to whether any given part had running water or electricity. Smells atrocious, serious risk of kidnapping. Leaking oil everywhere you look by the port, the locals will occasionally purposely damage a pipe in order to steal from it.</p>

<p>If Lagos is hell, then Nairobi is what the earth will look like after the rapture. Fuck me I‚Äôve never seen the like. Open sewers flow down the middle of the street, piles of rubbish everywhere, animals eating shit and the occasional dead body. </p>

<p>The threads that bind them are legion and I suspect apply to the entire continent and are as follows:</p>

<p>Corruption. You cannot take a shit without paying a bribe. Get through passport control? Bribe. Want the taxi driver to not shoot you? Bribe. Want to drive down a fucking dirt road into the jungle? Bribe. Check into your hotel? You better believe that‚Äôs a bribe. Occasionally the police, if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be in a country that has them (unlike Angola), will randomly stop you. They want a bribe. It‚Äôs absolutely endemic to these people, from the president of the country to the guy stamping passports. </p>

<p>Currency. Don‚Äôt bother. Just use US Dollars, makes the bribery easier. The local currency is normally worthless. </p>

<p>Infrastructure. There is none. Hardly any paved roads, airports built by the soviets if you‚Äôre lucky or the Chinese if you‚Äôre not. Dirt tracks serve even major population centres, I went to a couple of cities only accessible by fucking boat.</p>

<p>Violence. Normally the white man is pretty much immune - the locals know the police (again, if there are any) will actually investigate the killing of a foreigner. That doesn‚Äôt stop them laying into one another tho. I saw a bar fight in Angola where someone pulled out a fucking machete. Locals are more likely to own an AK47 than a car in some places, and the South Africans specialty seems to be getting smashed on payday and firing pistol rounds into the air. That and the thriving car jacking industry. Oh, and god help you if one of the mines had found a new seam that week as the workers get bonus pay - which they drink. Wars, revolutions and insurgencies can break out at a moments notice. I‚Äôbe been told more than once to be ready to flee at a moments notice, luckily it‚Äôs never happened. </p>

<p>Education - again there is none. Belief in witchcraft is common, most countries still prosecute people for it. Illiteracy is common, I‚Äôve encountered it at least once everywhere I‚Äôve been and it‚Äôs not viewed as a big deal. It‚Äôs difficult to get people to get medical attention or testing because they commonly view western medicine as witchcraft and will leave hospital isolation wards to visit shaman with a regularity that blows the fucking mind.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs probably more. I‚Äôm not saying every man woman and child in Africa is like this, but honestly it‚Äôs the majority of and it‚Äôs holding the entire continent back. The corruption especially has to be seen to be believed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Africa is the future</p>

<p>That means that rich people are promoting it heavily as the next destination for international capital to grow now that China is hitting the ceiling</p>

<p>I once saw a really weird tweet where a lizard person argued that Nigeria needed an aircraft carrier. That&#39;s part of this, international capital is just dumping into Africa and trying to hype it into wakanda tomorrow. China is also dumping all its money into Africa of course. Largely this is just a recognition that we have literally nowhere else to go. </p>

<p>There was literally a bunch of billionaires that got together to build this stupid hyper advanced ecologically friendly neoliberal woke city of the future off the coast of Nigeria called &quot;Eko&quot; :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/05/a-private-city-the-rise-of-eko-atlantic">https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/05/a-private-city-the-rise-of-eko-atlantic</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s starting to look a lot like vaporware tbh. Problem is that literally nobody in Africa or anywhere else can grow as reliably over the long term as China. They keep in coming up with these stupid lists of the next China based on countries that were doing good at that time, inevitably that country was just at the top of a bubble and falls flat on its face. Like the the first post, BRICS, that had fuckin Brazil on it. Yeah Brazil is gonna be the next China, take a look down there, such growth and advancement. MINT contains Nigeria and also turkey, both of which have stagnated recently. Like just a few years sheet the stupid acronym was developed.</p>

<p>Honestly all of these countries are shit holes, there&#39;s are like small sections of China at best you can stand in and convince yourself it&#39;s almost livable. India is a giant riot, Brazil has been the next world power for over a century, Indonesia is our woke moderate Muslim friend that is deeply ashamed to have to send you to prison for blasphemy and they have an entire national holiday dedicated to that time when they committed one of the largest genocides of the 20th century, Maylasia is southern China, Nigeria is a shit ton of oil and woke capitalists pretending that it&#39;s just about to pick up, there&#39;s nothing left to loot in Russia after we took everything on the 90s, Turkeys economy is largely based on convincing investors that EU accession is totally still a possibility and right around the corner, South Africa was always shit and was shoved on the first list to woke it up with the most powerful African country despite it being a small pathetic fraction of all the others that barely grows on a good day.</p>

<p>The process of developing as a country inherently involves being in a shit hole, basically the goal is to suppress consumption of consumer goods and reorient the economy towards investment in future production capacity. Which means you live in shit and are going to live in bigger shit for decades trying to catch up. And unless you&#39;re China you&#39;re probably not actually smart enough to grow continously, the only other choice after thar is to be Germany, Taiwan, South Korea, or Japan and just somehow convince the United States to deliberately rig international monetary policy to allow you to cannibalize their industry so that they can reorient towards a militarized economy. Breton Woods had to exist, you&#39;ll have to get them to sign that again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The praise comes from the same place as the hate my friend</p>

<p>It comes from fear</p>

<p>When fear is felt you can either respond by becoming aggressive and going into fight mode</p>

<p>I.e. To seethe</p>

<p>Or flattering the object of fear in an attempt to appease them in an attempt to avoid harm</p>

<p>I.e. To simp</p>

<p>All white Americans are afraid of black people, that&#39;s why they have that strange mix of broiling hatred and pro forms vague flattery</p>

<p>Really honestly a very similar dynamic between the mayo and the Kang, as between the incel and the thot. Do I attack the thot who  threatens my social standing with the shame of rejection? Or do I simp to the thot, thus trying to convince her to put off the task of rejecting me so that I can live in the delusion this will ever lead to acceptance? </p>

<p>The mayo will never approach the Kang with fear though, and neither shall the incel approach the thot. </p>

<p>To simp or to seethe? That is the question to ask.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I‚Äôve noticed there is a lot of people who are extremely insecure about their height, and I think it‚Äôs insane!</p>

<p>I believe short men are much more attractive than tall men. I believe around 5‚Äô and 5‚Äô5 is the perfect height for men.</p>

<p>For instance, the shorter you are, the easier you are to pick up and have anal sex. Guys who are tall usually weigh a lot more, and are harder to adjust it properly. In my experience men who are short also tend to be cuter than taller men, though that‚Äôs not a fact, it just happens more often that I see a cute small guy.</p>

<p>The weight is a major benefit, the fact that you can be 110 lbs without being super skinny is awesome. I can appreciate a man who is in shape but isn‚Äôt going to break my back trying to lift.</p>

<p>In conclusion, be happy about your height</p>
