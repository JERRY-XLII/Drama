    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Hun my situation is different than yours is but I‚Äôd like you to consider where I‚Äôm coming from. I am a married transgender woman and to ensure that my wife gets fucked good we have opted to seek out bulls. We have enjoyed threesomes in the past but over the past few months we have been more or less having sex in a cuckold situation.</p>

<p>The first few times she only had sex without me. It turns out that that she would tell the bulls about our situation and a couple had expressed an interest in letting me participate. So over the last month or so I would participate with my wife with two of her favorite bulls. During sex my services are usually to fluff the bull after each time he cums so he will fuck her more, but lately both bulls have demanded that I submit my ass for their pleasure. Both are 10‚Äù and usually take me after the first time with the wife which means I‚Äôve had to take well over 45 minutes of constant fucking.</p>

<p>The take away is not how much I liked it, but much more about how much the bull liked it. While my wife prefers to keep a purely sexual relationship with the bulls, I have hung out with both of them for drinks and have had some awesome conversations. They have stated that they actually felt more masculine fucking me then when fucking my wife. They say that they are almost unrestricted in how hard they can take me. It almost like they are trying to teach me a lesson.</p>

<p>So think of it this way this is all about them and less about you. However you could be the best part of the evening. So feel good and be comfortable with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ball cleveage shorts should be a thing.</p>

<p>I feel like society is ready.</p>

<p>I can imagine all sorts of cool outfits that show off my ball cleveage, for the office, for the pool, weddings and any sort of occasion.</p>

<p>Wearing ball cleavage shorts will allow us men to use our assets to flirt with women who are in power in hopes of gaining some unfair advantage over those who are less endowed.</p>

<p>There would be &quot;wonder shorts&quot; which push the balls up front and accentuate the cleavage. Like diamonds on a pedestal.</p>

<p>There would be a little hole in the shorts to let the ball cleavage poke through</p>
