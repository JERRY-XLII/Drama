    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but american leftwingism in the late 00s and early 10s were different than it is now. I actually wrote a comment about it. It was way more relgious focussed as the problem until it shifted to racism being the problem:</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the 10s the focus was on religion--especially on white american conservatives living in the bible belt who held America, and therefore the world back from some secular utopia by voting in Republicans. I&#39;m not even American, but got swept up in it as an edgy teenager, I was not the worst atheist keyboard warrior, but I did my part. </p>

<p>The problem (for the Democrats), of course, being that anti-religiousness can be used against other groups that the Democrats see as their own. So that perception of religion being the root of all evil had to be changed to something else, something more useful.</p>

<p>Scoot Alexander points it out better than I could:</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/30/new-atheism-the-godlessness-that-failed/">NEW ATHEISM: THE GODLESSNESS THAT FAILED</a></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>My solution to both these questions is: New Atheism was a failed hamartiology.</p>

<p>“Hamartiology” is a subfield of theology dealing with the study of sin, in particular, how sin enters the universe. Orthodox Christian hamartiology says we all have original sin because Adam and Eve ate the apple. Gnostic hamartiologies say we sin because we are ignorant of our true nature as celestial beings. Some heretical hamartiologies say that all of this is irrelevant, and we sin because we choose to.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>And New Atheism had an answer (to &#39;sin&#39;): religion.</p>

<p>That was it. It was beautiful, it was simple, it was perfect. We were the “reality-based community”. They were ignoring Reason and basing all of their opinions on three thousand year old fairy-tales because people told them they would burn in Hell forever if they didn’t. There was nothing confusing or unsettling at all about the situation, and we did not need to question any of our own beliefs. It was just that some people had been brainwashed by their church/mosque/synagogue to believe transparently wrong things, so they did. Sin began with the apple tree in Eden; conservatism began with the Bible in Jerusalem. Language separates us from the apes; not being blinded by religion separates us from the Republicans.</p>

<p>This was a socially momentous proposal. The Democratic Party is centuries old, but the Blue Tribe – the Democratic Party as a social phenomenon with strong demographic and ideological implications – can be said to have started in 2004.</p>

<p>As it took its first baby steps, the Blue Tribe started asking itself “Who am I? What defines me?”, trying to figure out how it conceived of itself. New Atheism had an answer – “You are the people who aren’t blinded by fundamentalism” – and for a while the tribe toyed with accepting it. During the Bush administration, with all its struggles over Radical Islam and Intelligent Design and Faith-Based Charity, this seemed like it might be a reasonable answer. The atheist movement and the network of journalists/academics/pundits/operatives who made up the tribe’s core started drifting closer together.</p>

<p><strong>Gradually the Blue Tribe got a little bit more self-awareness and realized this was not a great idea. Their coalition contained too many Catholic Latinos, too many Muslim Arabs, too many Baptist African-Americans.</strong> Remember that in 2008, “what if all the Hispanic people end up going Republican?” was considered a major and plausible concern. It became somewhat less amenable to New Atheism’s answer to its identity question – but absent a better one, the New Atheists continued to wield some social power.</p>

<p>Betweem 2008 and 2016, two things happened. First, Barack Obama replaced George W. Bush as president. Second, Ferguson. The Blue Tribe kept posing its same identity question: “Who am I? What defines me?”, and now Black Lives Matter gave them an answer they liked better “You are the people who aren’t blinded by sexism and racism.”</p>

<p>Again, it was beautiful, simple, and perfect. We were “the reality-based community”. They were ignoring Reason and basing all of their opinions on blind hatred and prejudice. There was nothing confusing or unsettling at all about the situation, and we did not need to question any of our own beliefs. It was just that some people had been brainwashed by white supremacy and an all-consuming desire to protect their own privilege, and so they did. Sin began with the apple tree in Eden; conservativism began with the cotton plant in Jamestown. Language separates us from the apes; not being blinded by bigotry separates us from the Republicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If child porn was the problem they wouldn&#39;t have sold Tumblr to WordPress, they&#39;d have sold it PornHub as soon as they came forward with the offer, since Pornhub has access to the FBI&#39;s database and actually can set up a proper system to detect CP and report it to the authorities.</p>

<p>Either that, or they&#39;d have kept the site and put up a better report &amp; moderation system to detect the stuff instead of banning all porn entirely - like, I dunno, literally ever other site out there.</p>

<p>lmao I can’t believe this same site just a few years ago was treating ron paul like the messiah and now they want him and his son to be murdered.</p>

<p>the great tumblr invasion after they banned nsfw stuff was an irreversible cataclysm and the barbarians have already infiltrated the roman gates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me tell you something real quick.</p>

<p>Let’s take a moment to talk about the “I sexually identify as an attack helicopter” meme, what it says about those who use it, and some useful ways of responding.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the genre, it derives from a 4chan copypasta story satirizing someone coming to grips with their gender identity. A guy dreams he’s a helicopter and announces his friends are “heliophobic” if they don’t call him “Apache” and let him kill people.
Since its arrival in 2014 or so, it’s become a shorthand way of mocking and dismissing any kind of gender or sexual identity conversation. Mention trans issues and DudeBro rolls into your mentions: “Oh yeah? Well I identify as an attack copter!” What’s most interesting is they really seem to think they’ve found the ultimate reductio ad absurdum. “If some dude can decide he’s a lady, I can decide I’m an attack copter, case closed, crack open the lulz!”
Put aside for a moment that these folks are admitting they consider “man” and “woman” to be as different as “human being” and “helicopter.” That they consider “wanting to use a restroom” equivalent to “the desire to murder with impunity.” What’s really going on is that they are blind to or deliberately ignoring how people experience identity and transition. They see the whole thing as simple playacting — and forcing others to play along because “political correctness.”
That distinction is important because no-one who posts that meme actually feels that they are an attack helicopter. They just think it’s hilarious because they can use the magic words that marginalized groups do, and demand people “play along.”
Now, I’m not advocating this, but the simplest, most effective response I have found is simple: Take them seriously. Not in a joking way, not with sarcasm. Rather, I treat them as if their words have real meaning.
“I’m glad you’ve been able to figure that out. Is your family supportive?”
“Has it been difficult at work?”
“Boy, I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with shitty responses.”
“You know, war may be the job you are given, but it doesn’t have to define you.”
I’ve also brought up the problem of cultural appropriation inherent in the use of “Apache” as a shorthand for “Attack helicopter,” given the US military’s history with Native Americans. Identity is complicated.
Now, this can be exhausting and time consuming and I absolutely say that anyone who just wants to block and go on with life when bro posts that shit is totally justified. It is no one’s responsibility to play this game. But I have seen some interesting things come out of it on occasion. Sometimes, the poster (or guy at the bar or whatever) admits he just thought it was funny and didn’t mean it to be so serious. More often, they keep up the “game” until admitting, no, it’s just hilarious anyone would take “that shit” seriously.
“Oh…” I say. “So you haven’t actually dealt with identity issues? You’re just making fun of people who have?”
Very occasionally, the person in question sobers up. In playacting as a person whose gender and sexual identity is dismissed—and being taken seriously long enough to have a conversation about it—they begin thinking about… the struggles of someone whose gender and sexual identity is dismissed. Occasionally, they even have the decency to look a little embarrassed.
Again, I don’t want to suggest that it is some kind of “CHECKMATE, LULZ!” finishing move, or that the “good” response to meme-dickery is spending huge amounts of time trying to coax an epiphany out of an internet shitlord. But for me, it’s helped to move beyond my frustration at the engineered callousness of the meme itself. Rather than arguing about why their claim is “invalid” and “just a dumb joke,” it’s a practiced act of kindness. And that — when I’ve got the patience for it — is something I know I need more of.</p>
