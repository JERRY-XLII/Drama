    <div class="md"><p>Look, I&#39;m sorry. Vaginas simply don&#39;t work that way. No matter how many times she has sex, a woman&#39;s vagina will not &quot;loosen&quot;. Just because you&#39;re insecure about sex making your penis smaller doesn&#39;t mean you get to take it out on women.</p>

<p>Look, it&#39;s a well-known fact that when a man has sex with a woman, the vagina will provide pressure to the penis. After having sex with enough women, all that pressure will cause his penis to shrink. If he has too much sex, it&#39;ll eventually become a micropenis, and no woman will want him. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important that men save their virginity for marriage and only have sex with their wives. After all, who wants to have sex with someone you can&#39;t even tell is in you?</p>

<p>It&#39;s like that thing with pencil sharpeners and pencils. A single pencil sharpener can sharpen a lot of pencils. However, if a single pencil gets sharpened by many sharpeners, it&#39;ll gradually shrink. Eventually, the pencil will become a stub, and it&#39;ll be useless. That&#39;s just how it is with men and women too. It&#39;s not something that can be helped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get extremely distressed at the mere thought of someone who thinks differently than you even having a platform to communicate on. So much so, that you do what you&#39;re doing right now, and spend your pathetically inept brainpower trying to disrupt and shit-up those platforms instead of finding something to fill the hole being gnawed into your own heart. You pretend that you&#39;re too smug to lower yourself to the level of those you disagree with, but the reality is that you&#39;re disturbingly obsessed with those same people and deeply desire to interact with them as much as possible. The reality is that they are, however crude or blunt, leagues ahead of you in intellect and perception. You&#39;re the equivalent of a guy who&#39;s mad he can&#39;t drive for NASCAR so you get into a plastic Power Wheels monster-truck and drive out onto the track during a race just to get in the way. You have no value other than the virtues you think you have, but arbitrarily abandon the moment you&#39;re confronted with your own ineptitude. Go fuck yourself, leftoid jerkoff. Maybe ChapoTrapHouse will stroke your pathetic ego. There&#39;s nothing for your transparent drooling leftoid-ass here except more hostility from me and I&#39;ve got just enough spare time to keep breaking it down for you. Your best option is to quit trying to disrupt venues that you don&#39;t like, and simply find something you do like that inspires some kind of genuine happiness and self-worth for you. This is not the place for that. You should go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same when it comes to dairy products. I&#39;ve always loved milk, no doubt in my mind about that, but there&#39;s a different level of intimacy when it comes straight from the source. Refrigerated milk is the most common way to drink milk, filled with all sorts of substances to make sure it stays better longer and reduce the chance of diseases.</p>

<p>My favorite thing to do however is to go a nearby farm and just suck it straight from the tit at night. Sure, the farmers dog gives a good fight, but it&#39;s worth it to get the sweet, room temperature milk straight from the cow itself. Something about it is so exhilarating and, if I had to be 100% honest, arousing.</p>

<p>The farmer has tried to shoot me a few times for sucking on the cows tit, but the best he&#39;s ever gotten was a graze on my arm. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m sexually attracted to the cow, because, well, I&#39;m not into something so large that reeks of manure. But the activity of calling the farmers wife a &quot;cow&quot; and having her attempt to be the shit out of me while groping at her human utters is something of a monthly entertainment of mine now.</p>
