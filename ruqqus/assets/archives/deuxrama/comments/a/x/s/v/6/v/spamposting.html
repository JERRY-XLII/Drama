Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

<p>Byzantine–Ottoman
wars</p>

<p>The Fall of Constantinople (Greek: Ἅλωσις τῆς Κωνσταντινουπόλεως, translit. Halōsis tēs Kōnstantinoupoleōs; Turkish: İstanbul&#39;un Fethi, lit. &#39;Conquest of Istanbul&#39;) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading Ottoman army on 29 May 1453. The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II, who defeated an army commanded by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that began on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of his Empire from Edirne to Constantinople and established his court there.</p>

<p>The capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, a continuation of the Roman Empire, an imperial state dating to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.[3] The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to Christendom, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.</p>

<p>It was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople&#39;s substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of gunpowder (which powered formidable cannons).[4]</p>

<p>The conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire[5] was a key event in the Late Middle Ages which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.[6]

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph
Byzantine emissaries to the Caliph</p>

<p>Al-Mu&#39;tasim (796–842) was the eighth Abbasid caliph. A younger son of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he rose to prominence as a key lieutenant of his brother Caliph al-Ma&#39;mun after forming a private army composed predominantly of Turkish slave-soldiers. When al-Ma&#39;mun died on campaign in August 833, al-Mu&#39;tasim succeeded him and continued many of his policies, including support for Mu&#39;tazilism. The traditional Arab and Iranian elites were weakened in favour of a new elite drawn from among the Turks, while the government was centralized around the caliphal court and a new capital founded to house it at Samarra. Al-Mu&#39;tasim also achieved lasting fame as a warrior-caliph by sacking the Byzantine city of Amorium in 838. The rise of the Turks would eventually lead to factional strife and the collapse of Abbasid power in the mid-10th century, but the slave-soldier system inaugurated by al-Mu&#39;tasim would be widely adopted throughout the Muslim world for centuries to come.

<p>Byzantine–Ottoman
wars</p>

<p>The Fall of Constantinople (Greek: Ἅλωσις τῆς Κωνσταντινουπόλεως, translit. Halōsis tēs Kōnstantinoupoleōs; Turkish: İstanbul&#39;un Fethi, lit. &#39;Conquest of Istanbul&#39;) was the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire by an invading Ottoman army on 29 May 1453. The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old Sultan Mehmed II, who defeated an army commanded by Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that began on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of his Empire from Edirne to Constantinople and established his court there.</p>

<p>The capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, a continuation of the Roman Empire, an imperial state dating to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.[3] The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to Christendom, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.</p>

<p>It was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople&#39;s substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of gunpowder (which powered formidable cannons).[4]</p>

<p>The conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire[5] was a key event in the Late Middle Ages which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.[6]
