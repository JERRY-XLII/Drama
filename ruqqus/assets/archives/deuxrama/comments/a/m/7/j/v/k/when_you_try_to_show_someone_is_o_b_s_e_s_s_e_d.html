<p>My IQ is extremely, almost embarrassingly, high. I&#39;ve never actually taken an IQ test, mind you, but my educated guess is that, if I did, my score would be whatever is the highest possible. No doubt your IQ is lower than mine, but please don&#39;t feel stupid or insecure about this, it&#39;s not your fault. You&#39;re probably just born that way. And you know what? Thank your lucky stars and subpar genetic makeup that you don&#39;t have to bear the burden of brilliance like I have to. Being incredibly intelligent is a curse. This is not just one of the many astute observations I have every day, by the way, it is a fact recently confirmed by science.</p>

<p>A source. I need a source.</p>

<p>Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.</p>

<p>No, you can&#39;t make inferences and observations from the sources you&#39;ve gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you&#39;ve gathered.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t make normative statements from empirical evidence.</p>

<p>Do you have a degree in that field?</p>

<p>A college degree? In that field?</p>

<p>Then your arguments are invalid.</p>

<p>No, it doesn&#39;t matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.</p>

<p>Correlation does not equal causation.</p>

<p>CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.</p>

<p>“Bad news, detective. We got a situation.”</p>

<p>“What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?”</p>

<p>“Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.”</p>

<p>The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.”</p>

<p>“Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.”</p>

<p>I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.</p>

<p>“Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t.</p>

<p>“Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up.</p>

<p>“Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?”</p>

<p>It didn’t seem like they did.</p>

<p>“Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.”</p>

<p>Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.</p>

<p>I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.</p>

<p>“Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled.</p>

<p>Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.</p>

<p>“Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.</p>

<p>I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!”</p>

<p>He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.</p>

<p>“All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.”</p>

<p>“Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy.</p>

<p>“Because I was afraid.”</p>

<p>“Afraid?”</p>

<p>“Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.”</p>

<p>I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.</p>

<p>“Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.”</p>

<p>He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.</p>
