    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about legal rights, but about cultural movement. It is very rare that the cultural/social outlook of a people directly match up with legislature in a region. The SCOTUS ruling is indicative of trans acceptance; however, that&#39;s not really true of most of the nation&#39;s culture. There is a very limited population of people that aren&#39;t made uncomfortable by trans people, and as a trans person, I must admit that is somewhat depressing. Roughly 1.8% of cismen are willing to date trans women, and 3.3% of women are willing to date trans men.</p>

<p>Now, the above figure is obviously swayed by the fact that - and this isn&#39;t something most trans people have a hard time discussing - SRS has been kind of limited until recently, and the most recent SRS techniques are still very limited in availability. However, I maintain the notion that, by the definition of the term transphobia, this figure represents transphobic feelings. I have several friends that are blanket unwilling to date a trans person, and I actually cut a few people off who told me that, no matter how far I am into transition, they&#39;ll keep calling me by my current name and using masculine pronouns. All of this behavior is indicative of discomfort with the idea of trans people as partners, which is what I&#39;m getting at: there is a widely ingrained inability to handle the idea of a trans partner. This is, inherently, representative of a society that is transphobic - while the people themselves may not be <em>actively</em> transphobic, it is still ingrained into their psyche.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said: the fact that transphobia exists has nothing to do with the legal <em>rights</em> of a group. Black people have all of the same legal <em>rights</em> as white people, but a black person is ~225% more likely to be in poverty than a white person. That indicates systemic racism, to me. Trans people suffer from similar problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing how there&#39;s &quot;systemic transphobia&quot; when trans people are among the least likely to be killed by the police.  </p>

<p>Your problems stem from the high comorbidity of transgenderism with other mental illnesses such as autism, B/NPD, ADHD and schizophrenia, not from cis people not wanting to date/fuck you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about the accuracy of your first claim, especially considering the fact that trans people are something like four times as likely to experience police violence in general, as opposed to the general community of the nation.</p>

<p>Speaking of police/trans relations, by the way: trans women are almost always placed in confinement with men, where they are exceedingly likely to suffer violence of some sort. This is because the prison system doesn&#39;t - or at least, has not until recently - recognized trans women as women. :)</p>

<p>Being trans certainly does have a high comorbidity rate, but I&#39;m not sure that nullifies my point above. If being trans magnifies the effects of things like autism, B/NPD, ADHD and schizophrenia, would that not mean that there is still a systemic issue that effects trans people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! I&#39;m really a wholehearted believer in the idea of &quot;kill them with kindness&quot;. I get angry sometimes, but I know that most people who behave hatefully towards me only do so because they don&#39;t understand me very well. As a result, I try to be as open and understanding as I can be. I find that it opens room for mature debate<sup>1.</sup></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Some of my comments in this thread are kind of childish at the start, and that stems from the fact that most of the time when a thread I&#39;m commenting in gets linked somewhere, there are chuds everywhere telling me to 41% myself, or things along those lines (I&#39;ve had six of those in the past day). I got my cool back now, and I&#39;m here to be nice. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, no. My trans identity has more to do with the social expectations of people. I&#39;m a very feminine person, and in the past two years, I&#39;ve started learning to do makeup, do my nails, I&#39;ve been getting more into fashion, etc. and while I greatly enjoy those things, I enjoy those things, at least in part, due to their femininity. I don&#39;t like that my interest in those things is seen as something that makes me &quot;unique among my people&quot; (men); I would like it if my femininity were seen as a natural part of who I am, rather than something that makes distinctive.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more to it than that - I posted two comments recently that are both pretty long - but that&#39;s the basis of it. I identify strongly with traditional feminine traits, and I don&#39;t want those things to set me apart from others, so I perceive myself to be trans.</p>

<p>...I also really wish I was small enough to have the sort of hug where I just get wrapped up in someone else, but I&#39;m six feet+, so that&#39;s not really happening no matter what surgery I get. lmao</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not on HRT yet, but I assure you, I am certainly trans. I have not, in my life, had a dream that wasn&#39;t a nightmare in which I was in a male body.</p>

<p>The definition of dysphoria is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t have gender dysphoria because my entire existence is subsumed by dysphoria. I suppose I should have said &quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s gender dysphoria or not&quot;, because I&#39;ve never known anything different. I most certainly dislike the body I exist in, but I can&#39;t tell you confidently if that&#39;s gender dysphoria or just because I don&#39;t like the appearance of men in general.</p>

<p>How do you get prescribed HRT? It is through getting a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. Because dysphoria is needed to be trans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt;My being trans is very much borne out of the fact that I hate <em>being a man</em>. I do not like the way men are represented in media, nor the way the vast majority of men choose to act. I don&#39;t like that my friends view women as objects, and I don&#39;t like that I haven&#39;t found a group of men that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> behave that way here in the good old U.S. of A.&#39;s southern regions. I don&#39;t like that I&#39;m looked down on for being into fashion, and into makeup, and musicians like Taylor Swift and romance novels and so on and so forth. I identify with the person that women are allowed to be; emotional and physically affectionate without being looked down on.</p>

<p>&gt;I know that my perspective is probably warped, but I don&#39;t really care. I would rather deal with all of the downsides of being a woman and all of the downsides of being trans than continue to be inherently grouped in with people like Donald Trump and <em>almost every other fucking man out there</em> by virtue of being a man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll ever be able to transition in the way I want to, but the whole thing here is that I&#39;ve always identified with women, felt comfortable around women, and felt appreciated women, where I&#39;m often bullied, excluded, and attacked by men. Maybe in a different world I could have just been an effeminate man, but the world that I lived in has magnified a desire to be perceived as female.</p>

<p>My dad, and most of the other male figures in my life, have bullied and made fun of me for being the person that I am. It&#39;s really not a healthy existence, but it&#39;s where I&#39;m at. It&#39;s an unfortunate reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll help to change your opinion at all, but ATG is something like 80% male - it used to be almost entirely girls answering, but then the people over on AskTeenBoys got a wind of ATG and jumped ships because the ATG mods are, on so many levels, better than ATB mods.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how being trans makes me a rapist, but I&#39;m pretty sure that falls into the transphobic rhetoric <em>I&#39;ve</em> been talking about, so I think we&#39;re at an impasse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a sex-neutral ace. I have less interest in sex than I do in reading; I have not, at any point, said that not wanting to have sex with someone is inherently transphobic. What <em>is</em>, in a very subliminal, deep-seeded form, is the absolute insistence that one cannot date trans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m getting at.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to date a black person because you din&#39;t find black people attractive due to their physical features? No harm, no foul. If the <em>concept of their blackness</em> turns you off of them, then you (you in the general sense, not you specifically) have some ingrained racism. That doesn&#39;t make you <em>evil</em>, but wouldn&#39;t the world be a better place if people didn&#39;t have little biases like that?</p>

<p>I agree. Not all Black People look the same. However with trans people the key issue is a neovagina at the present will never fully resemble a vagina and most people want to have kids which is impossible with a trans person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I mentioned elsewhere, neovaginal procedures are getting closer and closer to biological vaginas. The peritoneal vaginoplasty procedure is one of the closest, and imitates the key features of a vagina as far as sex is concerned (natural lubrication, potential for orgasm), and the texture is becoming more and more imitable. It&#39;s not identical, yes, but it&#39;s very close, and in the next few years could get to the point where the breaking-edge procedures are, to the penis-wielder, not mentionably different.</p>

<p>The children point is fair, but I&#39;m fairly confident that more than 1.8% of men are willing to date sterile women. Adoption is always an option, as they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re argument for trans women being like women is that with the aid of lab grown organs, reconstructive surgery, hormone thearpy, and plastic surgery, then I think it&#39;s pretty unrealisitc. There are like 8 billion people in the world. Most of these people live outside of progressive industrialized western socieities. What percentage of Trans women would realistically have access the amount of surgery and work done? </p>

<p>Even with universal health care, you probably wouldn&#39;t be able to get access to all the surgeries and procedures to pass as a woman, not without it taking decades of waiting time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I agree with you! It really sucks that trans women outside of (most) western nations won&#39;t have the opportunity to receive the sorts of treatments that we do in the western nations. It really sucks that most trans women and trans men won&#39;t ever be able to afford paying for all the procedures that they would like to have done.</p>

<p>However, I think that by working to address the social paradigm that is anti-trans, there may be a world down the line by a generation or two where transgenderism is an accepted facet of life, and those who identify as trans can have access to all of the procedures they want done in a span of one to two years.</p>

<p>If someone doesn&#39;t find black people attractive because there are physical traits that are commonly found in black people that that person doesn&#39;t find attractive, then it&#39;s whatever.

<p>I&#39;m not surprised you thought that I was saying it was &quot;unladylike&quot; to have a crude sense of humor since you think being a woman = painting your fingernails and being emotional. It&#39;s not the &quot;obscenity&quot; of your comment, it&#39;s the glaring typical maleness of it that is funny and absurd. And I mean beyond the painfully obvious reality women don&#39;t have penises - the use of the word cock, the bragging/exaggerating about size, using your penis size as a retort in a dust-up with a man to undercut his masculinity.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting how there is typically not nearly the effort put into unlearning male socialization as there is the cosmetic aspects of transitioning. No matter how well someone physically passes as a woman, their male behavior will still give them away.</p>

<p>Btw, it probably is not an issue because the assumption that you can only tell if someone is trans with a DNA test is already ridicolous. But we are discussing here under the assumption that there are no other defining features for transwomen.</p>

<p>Why would getting your penis surgically inverted make you indistinguishable from female people? Women don&#39;t have neovaginas. You&#39;ll be a sterile male, not an infertile female.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, another person who hasn&#39;t read any of my prior comments! It&#39;s really impressive, you guys are far smarter than me, all responding with identical statements.</p>

<p>While penile inversion has, for a long time, been the most common form of SRS, there are new procedures coming about that are much more advanced. There is a team of doctors that has been using peritoneal tissue to lab-grow vaginas, which don&#39;t suffer from the issues that penile inversion SRS suffers from (dilation, potential hair growth), and also self-lubricates. There&#39;s other research being done into stripping vulvar cells for similar purposes. There&#39; potential that cells from the head of the penis can be used in a similar form to the vulvar cells, and the vagina that these techniques produce is actually quite similar to a biological vagina. The technology and procedures are still quite new, which is why I explicitly stated that I want to wait before I commit to a procedure to see how far these new procedures go.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to force anyone</p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to shame people for not being attracted to certain people. That is wrong. I personally don&#39;t care about being called dumb shit like &quot;transphobe,&quot; but I know a lot of liberal women and young, suggestible kids do.</p>

<p>Robotic newspeak</p>

<p>people could not teach their kids to be uncomfortable with trans people?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s natural for people who are attracted to men to want to date men, and people who are attracted to women to want to date women. Trans people are simply not what they claim to be. Even most outwardly pro trans people, who trip over themselves to show everyone how &quot;tolerant&quot; they are, can&#39;t actually convince their body that a &quot;transwoman&quot; is a real woman and be physically attracted to them. Also, a lot of people want children and thus have no interest in dating someone who has sterilized themselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll teach my kids that they should date who they love and are attracted to, and they shouldn&#39;t let anyone shame them into dating someone they don&#39;t want to for any reason.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pre-op, pre-transition. I don&#39;t expect men to be attracted to me, as I currently look no different from them. I&#39;m trans, not stupid.</p>

<p>Ten years down the line, when I will hopefully have been in a place to pursue transition? If I were to have completed my transition and be largely indistinguishable from a sterile woman, I would really like to be treated as such, because that would be what I am.</p>

<p>But you still will be distinguishable from them. Skeletal structure, man hands and shoulders, more facial hair and body hair, man voice, the scars for the fake tits, a pseudovagina that has no ridges or ribbing when i fuck it an endless hormone treatment and painful dilation or else you revert to your real status as a man, in every eat you will always be distinguishable from a real woman even if shes sterile. An imitation is never as good as the real thing and thats all you&#39;ll ever be, an imitation. You would not be anywhere near the same as a sterile woman. </p>

<p>As is the &quot;desire a woman&quot; group. Trannies complain that they mostly get hit on by fetishists for a reason and its because straight men and women arent interested and most gay men and women arent intrested in a person who tried to become the very thing theyre not attracted to.</p>

The reason my timeline is so far out is because I&#39;m waiting for peritoneal vaginoplasties to become widely available, at which point that neovagina will have those ridges, will not need painful dilation, and will not suffer from the risk of hair growth that penile inversion suffers from (which is why I don&#39;t want penile inversion, as I&#39;m a pretty hairy person).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I told you this already, but I don&#39;t want anyone to fuck me anyways.</p>

<p>Like I said elsewhere in this thread, lab-grown genitalia are a thing, and recent advancements in SRS include human trials for lab-grown penises, which could result in either grown-from-male transplants or potentially grown-from-female autoplants, and the same is true vaginas, although the process is a little different there. Currently, there are a limited number of people who have these lab-grown genitalia, but in a decade or so, it may not be that rare.</p>

<p>Regardless, this entire argument is (for me, anyways) philosophical and kind of surreal at best, so I&#39;m not really expecting anything to change as a result of it.</p>

<p>However does such a preference/aversion match the word &quot;racist&quot; or &quot;racephobic&quot; in theory, linguistically? Sure, I guess it does. But then it&#39;s an acceptable form of &quot;racism&quot; or &quot;transphobia&quot; and those things aren&#39;t always bad.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/04/penis-transplants-anthony-atala-interview">This</a> article discusses labgrown penises. I don&#39;t know a lot about the deeper science behind this one, as I have no personally-vested interest in the subject.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lab-grown-vaginas-implanted-successfully-in-4-teenagers/">This</a> article discusses a pretty landmark case: four teens, all cis-fem with misformed vaginas, had vulvar cells collected and used to regrow much of the physical structure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-patient-gets-the-new-transgender-surgery-she-helped-invent/">This</a> article discusses the peritoneal vaginoplasty, a procedure by which cells from the peritoneum are collected and used to grow a vagina which can be implanted, much in the same was as the vulvar vaginoplasty is done.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the vulvar vaginoplasty or peritoneal vaginoplasty, I would be happy to offer answers if I have the knowledge. :)</p>

<p>Was becoming trans just a cool novel thought of you? Like: &quot;Just heard about trans people. Would actually be really nice to be a woman once.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, one does not simply identify as asexual. One actually is or is not. If you have sex and think it is cool, how are you asexual?</p>

<p>It&#39;s just the one that happened to strike me as funny after observing the whole supercilious thing you have going on, where your fragile ego desperately tries to convince others (and therefore yourself) that you are special, different, complex and significant.</p>

<p>Like calling yourself asexual because you haven&#39;t had sex in a year, which would be silly enough if you weren&#39;t  18. And then you have to add that part about how you&#39;ve never wanted to have sex more than you wanted to read a book. That&#39;s the amusing stuff to me. It&#39;s not different enough to be (fake) asexual, you have to try to paint a picture of yourself as some evolved being beyond the simplistic drives and tastes of the masses.</p>
