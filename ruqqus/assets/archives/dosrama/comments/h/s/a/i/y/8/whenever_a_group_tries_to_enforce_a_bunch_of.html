    <div class="md"><p>If extremist leftoid collectivists in that group take power then that might happen lol</p>

<p>They all agree that (s)he should get away from those old habits though, so looks like there&#39;s 2 concurrent ideologies there now - the 1000 intergenders xir zer stuff, and the need to prove the terfs wrong and insist that &quot;fully real woman now&quot; even if there&#39;s cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>So more binary/nb conflicts down the line? Hopefully lol</p>

<p>Ah, so not only do the trans agend-ists wanna compell everyone else into gendering them the way they want it, they think they have to force themselves into it as wellmao.</p>

<p>Why not break out of this cult and just call yourself whatever you want or whatever comes out? You were male not topo long ago; and in ways you still are; your sex identity isn&#39;t as unambiguous as standard cis people&#39;s, so now you&#39;ve got some kinda dissonance in your brain and call yourself a mail every now and tben.</p>

<p>Well that just shows that the history of having been and been born a man can&#39;t be erased from existence, even if you do manage to get rid of this &quot;habit&quot; at some point.</p>

<p>So just chill lol - try to change it if you want to, but hopefully this isn&#39;t because you think you have to conform to the whole &quot;transwoman is a real woman!&quot; ideology and lead by example lol</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please go away. Fuck off. I honestly hate you people so much. Your 4th grade understanding of biology is not an argument against my identity. Transition is something you get used to. If you were to look at scientific evidence puberty is different for us neurologicly. Our brains develop and start forming into the gender we feel we are. Transwomen are women. That is not an ideological disposition. That is a fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your brain became female even before the physical transition, but you&#39;ve still got remnants of the male one left?</p>

<p>What if it&#39;s a nonbinary thing instead and this is where that transition is stuck now, the destination it was heading? Now you&#39;re getting advice to &quot;practice in front of the mirror&quot; all the time and artifcially get it all the way to 100% foid, so clearly they&#39;re not expecting your brain to just evolve into that stage on its own.</p>

<p>Or it already made the 100% but &quot;you&#39;re not used to it yet&quot;? So a different brain department of yours still thinks it&#39;s mail but that&#39;s longterm memory and not part of the &quot;inner gender self&quot;?</p>

<p>K sounds a bit arbitrary to me - and either way, ciswomen don&#39;t have such confusions so that clearly makes you different from them already. You think that difference &quot;doesn&#39;t&quot; count, but well to others it does count.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That is not an ideological disposition. That is a fact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well idk are you sure? Seems like there&#39;s a very strong desire to &quot;prove the terfs wrong&quot;, and it&#39;s not consistent with the nonbinary thing and that whole spectrum - and wouldn&#39;t be the 1st time bs and nbs had a beef would it? Strange to hear how &quot;everything&#39;s unambiguously settled now&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You invalidate my identity </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I &quot;invalidate&quot; it? I can disagree on it, but you can keep your own view (unless it&#39;s like illogical or sth - but even then lol).m</p>

<blockquote>
<p>by going like oh yeah you can call yourself whatever but you will never be that thing. Like fuck you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well you evidently aren&#39;t yet; the future depends on whether the already available technology can make a 100% switch (and last time I checked it can&#39;t) or future tech will achieve that.</p>

<p>And even then there&#39;ll be voices that go by the birth gender, but they&#39;ll probably br rarer - and y&#39;all are gonna have to accept that and deal with it, simple as that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sociology and Biology and Psychology agree with transpeople medically. We are that thing. If someone looks like a woman,talks like a woman and acts like a woman can you guess what they are?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>K question do you need to dilate or not?</p>
