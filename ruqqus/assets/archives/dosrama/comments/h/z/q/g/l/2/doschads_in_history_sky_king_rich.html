    <div class="md"><p>On August 10, 2018, a Horizon Air Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 was stolen from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (Sea–Tac) in SeaTac, Washington. The perpetrator, 29-year-old Richard Russell, was a Horizon Air ground service agent with no piloting experience. He performed an unauthorized takeoff and two McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle fighters were subsequently scrambled to intercept the aircraft.</p>

<p>Seattle–Tacoma air traffic control (ATC) maintained radio contact with the occupant. The transmissions were on an open frequency and were quickly posted on social media websites. He said he was a &quot;broken guy, got a few screws loose I guess. Never really knew it until now.&quot; When ATC suggested that the plane be landed at Joint Base Lewis–McChord, the occupant refused: &quot;Those guys will rough me up if I try and land there. I think I might mess something up there, too. I wouldn&#39;t want to do that.&quot; He asked ATC if he could get a job as a pilot with Alaska Airlines if he successfully landed the aircraft. ATC said that &quot;they would give you a job doing anything if you could pull this off,&quot; to which he replied &quot;Yeah right! Nah, I&#39;m a white guy.&quot; He spoke of wanting to do &quot;a couple maneuvers to see what [the aircraft] can do,&quot; and requested the coordinates of an orca that had been brought to national attention, saying, &quot;I want to go see that guy.&quot; He stated that he did not want to hurt anyone, and in the final minutes of the communication apologized to his friends and family. </p>

<p>Near the end of the flight, the aircraft was filmed doing aerobatic maneuvers over Puget Sound, footage of which appeared on social media. A veteran pilot said the maneuvers &quot;seemed pretty well executed, without either stalling or pulling the wings off.&quot; When an air traffic controller requested he land the plane after these maneuvers, he said &quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t want to. I was kind of hoping that was gonna be it, you know?&quot; He added that he &quot;wasn&#39;t really planning on landing it.&quot;</p>

<p>The two F-15s attempted to direct the aircraft toward the Pacific Ocean, and did not fire on it. The Q400 ultimately crashed at 20:43 local time on Ketron Island in Puget Sound, Pierce County, Washington, killing the occupant and destroying the aircraft. The final descent at Ketron Island was determined to be intentional, and suicide was listed as the manner of death.</p>

<p>Richard Russell was a Horizon Air ground service agent from Sumner, Washington. He had been part of a tow team, which repositions aircraft on the airport apron, for about four years. An operational supervisor for Horizon Air described Russell as &quot;a quiet guy&quot; who was &quot;well liked by the other workers&quot;. During his communication with air traffic control Russell made a complaint about wages, stating: &quot;Minimum wage, we&#39;ll chalk it up to that. Maybe that will grease some gears a little bit with the higher-ups.&quot;</p>
