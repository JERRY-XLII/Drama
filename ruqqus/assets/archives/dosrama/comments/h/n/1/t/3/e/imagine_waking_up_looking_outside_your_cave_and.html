        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Except when they get closer they aren‚Äôt other ‚Äúpeople‚Äù you see that their skin is black and not pale like yours. In their hands they carry things you have never seen before later known as bows and spear throwers. Their faces are small and they have big foreheads, they are US anatomically modern humans. They may have had the first domesticated dogs in their company, which are like Huskies. Unfortunately these dogs notice you and start barking and chasing you. They have likely been driven here cause of war, drought, famine or animal migration and they are DESPERATE and will do anything to survive.</p>

<p>The dogs close the distance at a terrifyingly quick pace, barking and snarling. You try to shout at these animals to scare them away, waking your family and grab your spear to try to hold the dogs off. But as one of the beasts springs into the air right for you, you lose your balance and fall backward the dog promptly tears into your leg. You see the little faced men closing in, led by one clad in a cave lion‚Äôs pelt. In his hands he has a shaft of wood held together by a string. He puts a projectile on the string and pulls it and the projectile soars through the air before striking your eldest brother centermass. You shout out in pain throwing your spear with all your strength narrowly missing. The pain is so overwhelming you collapse and the dog goes straight to your neck. Only for your life to be saved by your eldest son as tackles the animal; wrestling it before driving a dagger made of bone into the beast‚Äôs throat.</p>

<p>A chorus of ululating shouts rises up. You try with all your strength to sit up and once you manage to do so you look to see your son grinning holding out a hand. It‚Äôs too late 3 of the little faced men are bounding towards him and you shout at your son to turn around before he‚Äôs tackled to the ground by one of them. They roll about on the ground with You watch your pregnant daughter get grabbed and dragged away by the savages. While your firstborn son is stabbed by a man wearing armor made with the bones and scalps of the other clans is your kind. Your grandchildren are bound up with plant fibers as they sob and lead away. Congratulations you have just encounted the apex of the genus Homo. Neanderthalensis, the doomsday clock starts now.</p>

<p>I wrote that myself btw</p>
