    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s funny because they keep repeating that mgtow means men getting triggered over women in such smug way as if it&#39;s some sort of original or clever comeback.</p>

<p>If they actually believed in that, they&#39;d just ignore them, but it&#39;s so obvious that such a small parcel of the male population really gets into their nerves just for existing. I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;re just mediocre women who really get angry at the idea that some guy out there isn&#39;t interested in their smelly vaginas?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had an intern at my job. His IG bio said &quot;engineer - bodybuilder - mgtow&quot;. </p>

<p>Quite dumb and spergy. He one day saw me peeling am apple and tossing it on a bin, and he started to chastise me for wasting those nutrients. He also tryed to ridicule an intern meeker than him, but we stopped him. He was a gym rat and talked about fitness and nutrition 24/7. Zero self-awareness on amything.</p>

<p>He voted for a real far-right party of my country (not what the libs in the us call &quot;nazis&quot;, I mean real hardcore rightoids), but then said he was ok with trannies. Also, one day he posted pics on his IG of our former dictator back in the 70s</p>

<p>He was extremely meek and servile, and his IQ was so low his work had to be discarded mostly after firing him.</p>

<p>We found his account in a steroid forum and r / steroids. He posted progress pics in underwear and said he was (at age 28) on his 9th cycle.</p>

<p>I remember he also took &quot;thermogenics&quot; (?), which accelerated his heartbeat and gave him fevers to burn more calories. Some days you could hear him breathimg very heavy, almost suffocating, his hands tremblimg sometimes. </p>

<p>Yet the guy wasn&#39;t The Rock at all. He looked unimpressive, he was a manlet with some +/- ripped parts, but his arms weren&#39;t big at all. Also he had no pecs.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the typical MGTOW poster. I have more sympathy for incels, at least they&#39;re funny sometimes and show self-awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A subset of rightoids love him. Also, there were never denazification-like events like in Germany, one of his ministers actually became the democratically-elected president of a region. </p>

<p>I live in one of the most anti-Francoist zones, if you did the Roman salute or chanted one of his slogans you&#39;d be at least ostracized (or even beaten). But in zones of Castilla León or Galicia I think it&#39;d be less of a deal. There was a lot of stability and prosperity in the 60s, so it&#39;s normal some old people feel nostalgia. </p>

<p>The party the intern votes is Vox. They&#39;re unapologetic in stuff like this and sometimes are close to calling for violence. I agree with 1.5 of their policies, but they&#39;re almost openly fascist, so I dislike them.</p>
