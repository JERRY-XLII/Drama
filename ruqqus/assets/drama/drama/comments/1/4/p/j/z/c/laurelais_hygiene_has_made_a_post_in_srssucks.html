<p><strong>Original post text</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been with LeftoNhahe in private modmail for a while. Some other users from this sub are in there too. Very recently we had a minor leak: <a href="/u/LeftonHahe">/u/LeftonHahe</a> [3] admitted that he is in Game of Dolls and HarrietPotter is a good friend of him in real life. He said he was the leaker.
His opinion on this is: &#39;I am a good mod, I didn&#39;t do anything wrong, I can choose who my friends are outside of reddit.&#39; I believe there&#39;s conflict of interest though, he&#39;s playing buddy with people like <a href="/u/Laurelai">/u/Laurelai</a> [-30][4] in a private sub. He&#39;s been friends with HarrietPotter before he even was made mod. Look at the age of his account. I won&#39;t leak modmail conversation, but believe me if I say this: a lot of other people in there were and still are pissed off at him. They lost <a href="/r/antisrs">/r/antisrs</a>[5] over bullshit like this, I myself wasn&#39;t there at the time so I couldn&#39;t give my opinion, I just enjoyed the popcorn.
The reason why I got banned: we were having fun with <a href="/u/lolsail">/u/lolsail</a> [+2][6] . I found a picture of him that he posted in <a href="/r/mildlyinteresting">/r/mildlyinteresting</a>[7] . He said he was okay if I posted a link to it, so I did. Laughs were had. I made a meme out of it. He thought it was funny. After that I posted the meme in a response to <a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a> [+2][8] .. Not long after that <a href="/u/lolsail">/u/lolsail</a> [+2][9] pmed me that he wasn&#39;t feeling comfortable with the meme anymore, categorizing it as official doxx. Note that it wasn&#39;t doxx when I made the meme, he made it to be doxx by stating that he wants it removed from reddit. So I did. I removed every picture of user <a href="/u/lolsail">/u/lolsail</a> [+2][10] , even though he thought it was funny: Okay, I actually laughed at that one.
Reddibots still has the old screen containing the links to the pictures. What funny was: he even posted a &#39;better&#39; picture of him where we could see his Edward Scissorhands haircut (I&#39;m not kidding). He was perfectly fine with everything at the time. We were having a laugh. He even thanked me in PM. Now this is where it comes together. I know <a href="/u/LeftoNhahe">/u/LeftoNhahe</a> [11] is in <a href="/r/gameofdolls">/r/gameofdolls</a>[12] , I was even planning on taking him down because of that, (sorry Left but I just don&#39;t like people that team up with the enemy). You are saying that you&#39;re acting like a mole, but we both know you aren&#39;t and they will never give you juicy information. You are being played by harrietpotter because you&#39;re gullible, someone in modmail even compared you with an Aspie (not me this time, but it was funny as hell). The reason for his friendship with her: &#39;I was feeling very bad at a time in my life when broke up with a girl. HarrietPotter was there for me. She was very supportive and I like her as a friend. We even watch youtube together over skype.&#39;
Guess who else is in <a href="/r/gameofdolls">/r/gameofdolls</a>[13] ? <a href="/u/Lolsail">/u/Lolsail</a> [14] . Not only him but a lot of people you don&#39;t want to be associated with:
<a href="/u/cojoco">/u/cojoco</a> [+2][15]
<a href="/u/Laurelai">/u/Laurelai</a> [-30][16]
<a href="/u/anguilax">/u/anguilax</a> [17] (HarrietPotter)
<a href="/u/brucemo">/u/brucemo</a> [18] (aSRS mod under different nick)
etc.
People in modmail asked <a href="/u/LeftoNhahe">/u/LeftoNhahe</a> [19] to make a screenshot of all the mods and regulars there. He didn&#39;t do it. But he&#39;s a good mole right?
TL;DR: <a href="/u/lolsail">/u/lolsail</a> [+2][20] and <a href="/u/LeftoNhahe">/u/LeftoNhahe</a> [21] are in <a href="/r/gameofdolls">/r/gameofdolls</a>[22] together with some despicable people like <a href="/u/Laurelai">/u/Laurelai</a> [-30][23] and <a href="/u/HarrietPotter">/u/HarrietPotter</a> [24] . I have reason to believe that they massively reported me and <a href="/u/ss2james">/u/ss2james</a> [25] to the admins over something that wasn&#39;t even doxx.
PS: WHO THE FUCK CARES ABOUT A SHADOWBAN ANYWAY IF I CAN JUST MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/14p813/i_am_laurelais_hygiene_i_got_shadowbanned_for/">Here is the link to post</a>. The comments range from conspiracy theories about GameofDolls, to him calling out other SRSsucks mods as being in cahoots with &quot;the enemies.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>That&#39;s not it though!!</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ekmjr.png">He also leaked a long ass mod mail between the SRSsucks mods</a> about SRS.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
