        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>edit</strong> update: McAfee has <a href="http://www.whoismcafee.com/">started a blog</a> to document his crazy adventures on the run. </p>

<p>disclaimer: everything involved in the linked threads sounds foolishly dangerous. </p>

<p>Okay I&#39;m briefly coming out of retirement to post this. </p>

<p>So, there is some news that <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5959812/john-mcafee-wanted-for-murder">John McAfee may or may not be a suspect for murder</a> in Belize, a country in Central America John escaped to avoid a $5 million lawsuit in the USA. </p>

<p>However, the interesting drama occurs in the <a href="http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question">bluelight drug forum</a>, where McAfee posts as the user stuffmonger. He outs himself several times in the thread, once claiming to have bestiality blackmail on his boss </p>

<p>I&#39;ve read all 41 pages and I still can&#39;t tell what is going on. If you have the next couple hours free I recommend skimming all of it, because it is simply <em>insane</em>. </p>

<p>So, apparently John claims he doesn&#39;t know much about chemistry, but has this huge chemistry lab setup so that he can convert the bath-salts drug MDPV into a hypersexualized &quot;tan&quot; freebase version, that apparently briefly existed in the early 90s. Apparently John is the only one now that knows how to create this stuff, and goes around carefully giving a cabal of a couple hundred trusted users in Belize a form of this cut with Excedrin, to prevent them from doing too much and raping all the country animals.  He originally posts asking how he can do this process more efficiently, then when users ask how to make this stuff, he posts 3 different versions of how to go about synthesizing it. </p>

<p>Except only John and his apparent alts can make this magical stuff. Several other users try and fail. <a href="http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page11">On page 11</a>, he explains the only thing that comes close is this bath salts product called Ultimate Sextacy from Am-Hi-Co. Page 11 is also where he outs himself as John and posts pictures of his compound and lab. </p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page12">page 12</a> is where he is first accused of astroturfing for Am-Hi-Co by lineartransform. This continues on for the rest of the thread. I still don&#39;t know if he was actually astroturfing, as his recommendation elsewhere of the product and other products of the company isn&#39;t exactly glowing and the process to synth this magical tan stuff sounds incredibly dangerous. Another user claims Am-Hi-Co is based in Belize, but I couldn&#39;t find out if that is true or not. Another odd thing is that the Am-Hi-Co website goes out of its way to claim its products are not MDPV derivatives, but if this is astroturfing it makes it readily apparent it is a MDPV derivative, so it doesn&#39;t make much sense to me why he would astroturf this product in that manner. </p>

<p>Regardless, the thing begins to get really sketchy. <a href="http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page14">On page 14</a> user nunezzorro comes in with glowing reviews for this new type of custom freebase that he was only able to get right by cooking 1 out of 10 tries. A mod calls BS because the IP is the same one of stuffmonger, who later explains it&#39;s because the country has one internet provider and like 2 computers.  </p>

<p>However, later <a href="http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/541627-Hello-and-an-MDPV-Question/page40">on page 40</a> mmax91 claims the photos of stuffmonger and nunezzoro have:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>same IP address, the same digital camera (Canon G11) with the exact same serial-number and settings, use the same serial-key for Photoshop, live close to each other and magically get the same &quot;Tan&quot; product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in-between is 30 pages of back and forth between users convinced this is a troll, that it is an incredibly dangerous thread that should be pulled, that this conversion is somehow caused by the bacteria psuedomonas, or convinced it somehow will or has worked. Eventually at page 41 the thread is pulled by mods, who still have no idea what is going on. The most likely explanation to me is that John was on a year long MDPV bender and completely lost his mind, convinced he could synth this magical form of MDPV. </p>
