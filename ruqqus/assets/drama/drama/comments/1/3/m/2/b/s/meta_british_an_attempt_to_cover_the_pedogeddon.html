        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s recently been a <strong>lot</strong> of drama in the UK about pedophiles.</p>

<p>The core of all of it is sad - vulnerable people were sexually abused, many times.  Some of them reported the abuse.  They were ignored, and the abuse continued.  The abuse spanned many years.</p>

<p>The drama comes from the way the abuse allegations were revealed.  This is complicated, so bare with me.</p>

<p><strong>1) Jimmy Saville OBE (now dead).</strong></p>

<p>Jimmy Saville was a popular radio DJ and TV personality.  &quot;Jim&#39;ll Fix It&quot; was a much loved tv show.  He did a lot of work for charity.  When he died the BBC had a set of commemorative programmes about him.</p>

<p>There had been long running rumours in the industry that Saville had been an unpleasant man, and perhaps abusive, but no-one had done anything about it.  A BBC tv programme (their flagship news programme, &quot;NewsNight&quot;) had investigated, and came to the conclusion that he was a child abuser.  That programme was not shown; BBC bosses cancelled it.  </p>

<p>Some time later another programme on the competing ITV network did their own investigation into Saville.  They decided he was a serial abuser.</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9580096/Jimmy-Savile-Questions-about-why-BBC-dropped-Newsnight-investigation.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9580096/Jimmy-Savile-Questions-about-why-BBC-dropped-Newsnight-investigation.html</a>)</p>

<p>(<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9577087/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-sex-abuse-claims-ITV-goes-where-BBC-fears-to-tread.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9577087/Sir-Jimmy-Savile-sex-abuse-claims-ITV-goes-where-BBC-fears-to-tread.html</a>)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where a lot of drama explodes - why the hell didn&#39;t anyone say anything?  Why were the victims ignored? How much did the BBC know? (BBC have a yearly charity drive called &quot;Children in Need&quot;; they banned Saville from any involvement because they didn&#39;t like the allegations.) etc etc.</p>

<p>The BBC then do a programme (using their flagship documentary &quot;Panorama&quot;) about what went wrong at &quot;Newsnight&quot;.  </p>

<p>More victims come forward.</p>

<p>More stories are heard.</p>

<p>It turns out that this man was evil and he abused very many people over very many years.  He may be one of the UK&#39;s most prolific sex offenders.</p>

<p>Bizarrely this radio and tv personality was invited into a high security psychiatric hospital, as a volunteer &quot;help&quot;.  (To make the jargon clear: this is a place for very disturbed people involved in serious criminal behaviour.  The Yorkshire Ripper is at Broodmoor.)  Saville used this opportunity to abuse very vulnerable women detained at Broadmoor.</p>

<p>So far it&#39;s all pretty shitty for the BBC - many people lost their jobs.</p>

<p><strong>2) North Wales Children&#39;s Homes</strong></p>

<p>And then there&#39;s some separate allegations about abuse in Children&#39;s home in Wales.  These were serious allegations and nothing much was done and there was an investigation at the time, but justice wasn&#39;t done.  The BBC did a programme.  Remember that they&#39;re under considerable scrutiny because of piss-poor journalism.</p>

<p>A victim says he was abused by (at the time) a senior tory politician, but does not give the name.  The BBC allow that comment to be broadcast.</p>

<p>Turns out that when the victim was originally interviewed by police, many years ago, they showed him a photograph of someone that the victim identified as the abuser.  The police put a name to that photo.  But they put the wrong name to that abuser.</p>

<p>Twitter is abuzz - who is this politician?  A name is found.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister appears on a breakfast TV show, and the presenter hands over a list of alleged pedophiles.  Accidentally this list is shown on camera.</p>

<p>Very great harm is done to this man, who is not a pedophile, because the most important news programme on the BBC fucked up again.</p>

<p>That innocent man is now going after people who tweeted or re-tweeted his name.  Regular people are being asked to pay £5 to a children&#39;s charity.  Celebs will be asked to pay much more.  The BBC has already had to pay £187,000 and that sum was kept low because of the way the BBC is funded.  ITV (the breakfast programme people) will have to pay considerably more.</p>

<p>This is a partial attempt to cover the events.  There aren&#39;t many links to drama, because there&#39;s just so much.  And I might have got a few details wrong.</p>
