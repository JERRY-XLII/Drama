        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">33</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-12-21 by <a class="author" href="/assets/drama/user/[deleted].html">[deleted]</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>While I have not posted to <a href="/r/anonymous">/r/anonymous</a> in the past, I have been a lurker for quite a while and have been following, supporting, and cheering-on Anonymous IRL for quite some time now.</p>

<p>This is an effort to continue documenting Laurelai&#39;s sociopathy and general unbalanced mental state. In a recent popular thread in <a href="/r/anonymous">/r/anonymous</a>...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It begins in a spectacular melodramatic fashion where Laurelai claims that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/154hea/twitter_just_suspended_the_most_popular_anonymous/c7je1ij">an srser saved my life ( literally)</a></p></li>
<li><p>A hypocritical stament is made where she has the audacity to tell someone to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/anonymous/comments/154hea/twitter_just_suspended_the_most_popular_anonymous/c7jjaku">&quot;lol get a life&quot;</a> after just admitting to have been given a new lease on one. I gift her Reddit Gold for this comment after being stupefied at her lack of irony and self-awareness.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide to publicy <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EYNVq.png">call her out</a> on this. </p></li>
<li><p>The post is deleted shortly thereafter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Laurelai didn&#39;t appreciate me calling her out in front of Anonymous, and predictably falls back on SRS tactics of deleting dissent and discourse.</p>

<p>So I take it to <a href="/r/anonymous">/r/anonymous</a> modmail to get to the bottom of this. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>She completely takes the defensive position and starts spouting lies by <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Aaj24.png">claiming I&#39;m an SRDer</a> and that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/izjkU.png">I&#39;m an invader</a> when I&#39;ve been a lurker in anon and have been following them for quite a while now.</p></li>
<li><p>Bottom-mod FVAnon <a href="http://i.imgur.com/10mSO.png">chimes in</a>, and Laurelai states, tounge-in-cheek (?), that Anonymous is into Misandry&quot; with a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/i6pPz.gif">childish image</a> of ScarJo from The Avengers</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Q3XOC.png">Further reinforcing</a> that <a href="/r/anonymous">/r/anonymous</a> is part of SRS/The Fempire with the image macro <a href="http://i3.minus.com/jswZu4dVVmalL.jpg">&quot;Ceterum Censeo Reddit Delendam Esse&quot;</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Co8yk.png">Further lobbing an accusation of hypocrisy</a> is met with a <a href="http://i.minus.com/ibxo9BNVYxQgks.gif">childish anim</a> where she implicitly states she does not care. She seems honestly comfortable and OK with being perceived as a hypocrite.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing her pattern of evasion, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H2S3T.png">taunts</a> further with <a href="http://i.minus.com/i5xLvHM9bda8U.gif">another image</a> claiming she&#39;s not even reading my pleas for debate and discourse. An issue on my end makes me believe I have been banned from posting to <a href="/r/anon">/r/anon</a>, and later realize my statement was in error. State so.</p></li>
<li><p>Further taunting by asking <a href="http://i.minus.com/iP3qeuHMYmHEI.gif">If I am mad</a> ?</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Tmb2v.png">I decide to wrap things up</a> as there is just no getting through to someone like her.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, today folks, we have learned that <a href="/r/anonymous">/r/anonymous</a> is not too far removed from SRS after all.</p>

<p>Absolutely shameful. </p>

<p>I expected better from Anonymous, and much like Sergey Titov has ensured I will never buy anything associated with him, I will never again support Anonymous given this is how their agents conduct themselves and are OK with being associated with SRS.</p>

<p>Anon was supposed to destroy the Sith. Not join them.</p>
