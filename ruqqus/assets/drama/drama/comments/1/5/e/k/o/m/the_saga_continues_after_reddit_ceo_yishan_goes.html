        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, this applies to me and my subreddit. My apologies if this is frowned upon. This issue is bigger than us, and I wanted to give it some exposure. I&#39;m borrowing some words from one of our user&#39;s submissions in ModTalk.</p>

<p>Bitcrunch, community operations, removed <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/14zjt9/agent_orange_and_avfm_expose_feminist_hate_at/">this</a> submission two days ago, claiming there had been complaints. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/14z3is/merry_christmas_the_package_has_been_delivered/c7hv3pn">My comment</a> was also removed at the time.</p>

<p>As most of you will recall, a couple of months ago ShitRedditSays embarked on a campaign of intimidation and harassment against ViolentAcrez. I think <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/11ea2m/project_panda_va_outed_peaches_thawed_all_around/">this</a> was the original submission. Some argued that he brought it on himself (and perhaps he did). The issue was that the doxxing was allowed to continue. <a href="/r/ModTalk">/r/ModTalk</a> was up in arms, and eventually Yishan, Reddit CEO, stepped in to clarify the rules surrounding doxxing. <a href="http://imgur.com/7oWt3">This</a> is a screenshot of the submission by Yishan. He clearly states:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>We will ban doxxing posted to reddit.</li>
<li>We will ban links to pages elsewhere which are trivially or primarily intended for the purposes of doxxing (e.g. wikis or blogs primarily including dox).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>TL;DR: We stand for freedom of speech. We will uphold existing rules against posting dox on reddit. But the reality is those rules end at our platform, and we will respect journalism as a form of speech that we donâ€™t ban. We believe further change can come only from example-setting.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, of course, caused outrage. It is an open invitation to doxx users on Reddit. We accepted it because free speech and practicality etc. Yishan&#39;s word is ultimately law. However, now we have an example of a similar case, only from the other side of this little gender studies battle. This time, however, the article is removed immediately. No pretense of free speech or removing instances of it being impractical. This time, &quot;there&#39;s no grey line here&quot;. Now, apparently, the rules have changed again. So where exactly do the moderators stand? Why is <a href="http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/happy-birthday-radfem-scthhum/">this</a> article banned, but <a href="http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web">this</a> one allowed to remain? While one is certainly more verbose, they both represent the lowest form of &quot;investigative journalism&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/8pUzR.png?1">This</a> is the conversation I&#39;ve been having with bitcrunch so far. I am particularly concerned with the apparent unwillingness to give us any firm rules on this matter. Yishan made &quot;Reddit&#39;s&quot; stance very clear. I have explained that to bitcrunch, yet she seems to disagree with Yishan, only insofar as <a href="/r/MensRights">/r/MensRights</a> is concerned. I wonder how many other subreddits and users this double standard applies to?</p>

<p>In other words, the admin, at their whim, may decide what is considered &quot;trivial&quot;, or &quot;primarily intended for the purposes of doxxing&quot;. Yet, inexplicably, the Gawker article did not fall under this definition. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/15d5rg/big_red_high_school_football_team_raped_girl/">Here&#39;s another example</a>.</p>

<p>I believe we have the smoking gun. This is an example of ShitRedditSays being allowed to continue a disgusting campaign of intimidation and harassment. When the other &quot;side&quot; returns fire, all links are instantly removed. This speaks to the very integrity of Yishan&#39;s statements. I contacted him four days ago requesting clarification and have had no reply. I have no other choice but to take this to the larger Reddit community.</p>

<p>Please note I&#39;m away at the moment and may not be able to reply to questions immediately. I&#39;m asking the other mods to feld questions and provide info when necessary.</p>
