<p>Nov 22 14:10:45 <strong>&lt;arcana&gt;</strong>    I am genuinely afraid of being pitchforked out of the Fempire for arguing with greenduch, Tesseraction.</p>

<p>Nov 22 14:11:03 <strong>&lt;arcana&gt;</strong>    Maybe you find this funny and stuff, but I am actually sad over this.</p>

<p>Nov 22 14:12:22 <strong>&lt;arcana&gt;</strong>    I spend  a week watching her girlfriend for her while she&#39;s <strong>[redacted]</strong>, and I&#39;ve been out with them repeatedly in addition to that, and like, I&#39;m being treated like a stranger.</p>

<p>Nov 22 14:13:00 <strong>&lt;arcana&gt;</strong>    Maybe You Folks Could just ban me from everything and tell me to get lost.</p>

<p>Nov 22 14:13:09 <strong>&lt;arcana&gt;</strong>    I kwnow you don&#39;t like me much yourself, so win/win?</p>

<p>Nov 22 14:14:35 <strong>&lt;Tesseraction&gt;</strong>  I want to make one thing clear, I do not dislike you in any way, and certainly have no intention to allow you to be banned from any Fempire community areas</p>

<p>Nov 22 14:14:50 <strong>&lt;Tesseraction&gt;</strong>  but at the same time, I&#39;m not going to play into an argument between yourself and greenduch</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have Tesseraction, the Fempire&#39;s self-proclaimed &quot;IRC guy&quot;, dismissing a concern of former Fempire member, arcana on IRC/eternityblooming on reddit. That&#39;s me, by the way. I was trying to seek mediation between greenduch, Laurelai, and myself so we could come to terms with some issues we&#39;d been having with one another, to reconcile as it were. I had implored ArchangelleStrudelle to do so too, but an accident in not editing Laurelai&#39;s name out of a single line of text caused him to develop selective hearing, and as such, let the shit go on.</p>

<p>I reached out repeatedly to greenduch and Laurelai themselves, and to third parties so that we could settle our issues one another and remain on amiable terms. I thought Laurelai and I were cool for a bit, but she kinda pulled some bullshit on me on the <a href="/r/Civcraft">/r/Civcraft</a> server and effectively prompted me to demand she stop acting like a sperglord. I also called her ugly, now that I think about it a little bit more, but tl;dr.</p>

<p>This is how the Fempire handles disputes with it&#39;s members. Silence. No empathy. Feigned empathy at best, but it&#39;s nothing more than crocodile tears. This was going on for several weeks and it was wearing my patience thin and led me to create the <a href="/u/pinkduch">/u/pinkduch</a> moniker to lash out at those who I had fallen out of favor with.</p>

<p>This is but a brief synopsis. I will post more logs if this one is well received. As an epilogue of sorts: I&#39;m not really doing so great at the moment. I&#39;m kinda feeling raw, so if a moderator finds this distasteful, feel free to remove, just please no personal attacks against me.</p>
