        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>[Special thanks to <a href="/u/sycoraxfleet">/u/sycoraxfleet</a> for writing this up!]</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I did my research, but this is not intended to be a witchhunt. Don&#39;t make it one.</p></li>
<li><p>This is ongoing drama. The little guy is still messaging us, and we&#39;re still cracking up.</p></li>
<li><p>in modmail screenshots, Sycoraxfleet&#39;s posts are in green.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For a few weeks, I&#39;ve been getting nasty messages and replies from a certain <a href="/u/cunt_gettin_eaten">user</a> and their various alts. For a while, I could expect to receive at least one nugget of homophobia and hatred in my inbox, maybe two if I was lucky. i have no clue what I did to charm him, but he&#39;s graced me with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/z0qLW.png">this loveliness</a>. Then it stopped.</p>

<p>And it started up again!</p>

<h3>The good stuff</h3>

<p>Apparently, CGE does not like SRD at all, as evidenced by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/12lan3/til_that_until_it_was_forcibly_suppressed_during/c6w8lco">this invasion</a> in an old linked TIL thread.
Of course, CGE was banned for invasion and rude comments.</p>

<h2>SRDGoneWild</h2>

<p>A few days ago, CGE discovered <a href="/r/SRDgonewild">/r/SRDgonewild</a> in the deep recesses of the Popcorn empire, and was so offended that he set off <a href="http://imgur.com/mGQqT">this poetic, passionate exchange</a> with the moderators.</p>

<p>The final straw was when CGE called one of SRDGW&#39;s Irish mods British, after which he was promptly banned by me. When CGE was notified of his ban, he picked <a href="http://imgur.com/cqTQh">another fight</a> with SRDGW. TwasIWhoShotJR calls him out for having nothing better to do on Thanksgiving except for harass other people.</p>

<h2>SRDGWBroke</h2>

<p>CGE announces that he will create a rival subreddit, <a href="/r/SRDGWbroke">/r/SRDGWbroke</a>. But a SRDGW mod beats him to the punch and bans him. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SRDGWBroke/comments/13n3ft/exposing_myself_f/">CGE comments</a> in the new sub under one of their alts.</p>

<h2>The disappointing birth of FSRD</h2>

<p>On an unrelated note, our courageous troll announces on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SRDBroke/comments/13n1fv/introducing_rfreesubredditdrama_an_alternative_to/">SRDbroke</a> a new rival to SRD called <a href="/r/FreeSubredditDrama">/r/FreeSubredditDrama</a>. Its slogan is &quot;better than fascist SRD&quot; and allows for unbridled freedom of speech and expression.</p>

<p>Its first post is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/freesubredditdrama/comments/13n2ba/gay_redditors_are_such_drama_queens/c75i5jw">this incredible sweeping generalisation</a>. In that thread, the sub is universally criticized. But CGE is quick to lay the banhammer on at least two SRDGW mods (I can&#39;t post there).</p>

<p>It is then revealed that CGE invited <a href="/r/ainbow">/r/ainbow</a>&#39;s Jess to help run the sub. Her brilliant response:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/freesubredditdrama/comments/13n2ba/gay_redditors_are_such_drama_queens/c75i5jw">I have no idea why, as a moderator of ainbow, I would be invited to moderate a shitty subreddit that wants to troll ainbow and call people &quot;fags&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jess is then banned.</p>

<p>I suspected CGE to have advertised his new project in other places, and after searching &quot;freesubredditdrama&quot; I found a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/DramaLog/comments/13n5d2/srd_lawlt_meta_introducing_rfreesubredditdrama/">Dramalog</a> link to a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/13n4xq/meta_introducing_rfreesubredditdrama/">removed post</a> in <a href="/r/Subredditdrama">/r/Subredditdrama</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/13q12c/we_are_the_moderators_of_rsubredditdrama_aua/c7654ry?context=2">CGE shows up in the SRD AMA</a>. Perhaps CGE has been messaging the mods there as well.</p>

<h2>YOU SUCK!! Now please do me a favor</h2>

<p>Today, CGE messaged SRDGW once again, this time requesting that FSRD be sidebar&#39;d. Here is the clusterfuck- <a href="http://imgur.com/cneky">They put the number 9 in the subject line</a></p>

<p>In his defence, he did say please, albeit spelling it wrong and still being annoying.</p>

<p>Choice comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>And you&#39;re an ablist hypocrite with bizarre sexual fetishes. That was just a test post. Fill it up with content you like, you retard.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>According to your logic, &#39;idiot&#39; is ableist. Do you see now how retarded it is now when you pussies get upset by the word &quot;fag&quot;??</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t &quot;go to school&quot; anymore. I&#39;m doing my masters.</p>

<li><blockquote>
<p>That English guy...</p>

<p>He&#39;s Irish.</p>

<p>Same differnce.</p>
