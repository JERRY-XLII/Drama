        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Oh dear. One of the fathers of a child killed in the Sandy Hook shooting did a televised interview, and was seen smiling and laughing right before the interview started. Innocent enough, right?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urrRcgB581w">Cue shitstorm</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fathers of slain children do not go around joking and laughing the next day this guy is a fraud and he is an actor and so is the aunt that spoke before him and this entire shooting is a scam to take away gun right for a much bigger global domination plan.the father of the shooter was also to testify over the libor scandal.as he was VP of GE and Webber Paine company that suites were filed against and documented at stanford advocates web site,both aurora and Sandy Hook were referenced in the Batman move dark knight rises</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The comment section of that video is no better, and is riddled with freak-outs, insults, and arguments.</p>

<p>Other (more insane) users are now posting bizzare <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL4pREERbcA">conspiracy videos</a>, all with the same general slant that the shooting was a hoax, and that Aurora was also a hoax, and the two are thus related (again, the comment section is riddled with mini-arguments, insults, and hilarity).</p>
