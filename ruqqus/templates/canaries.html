# Warrant Canaries

Warrant canaries are a statements put out by service providers indicating that they have not been required to comply with certain types of secret legal orders.

The First Amendment protects the publication of these statements, and it also prevents the government from compelling an organization to make a canary statement that is not true.

The name comes from canaries used in coal mines. When the canary died, miners would know oxygen was low and that they needed to evacuate. Similarly, when a canary statement "dies", users can infer that the statement is no longer true.
