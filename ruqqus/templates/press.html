Welcome to the Drama press portal.

## Press Releases

Official Drama press releases are posted in [+DramaPress](/+DramaPress?sort=new).

## Logo

Use primary logos on light backgrounds, and alternate logos with dark backgrounds. Logos may be uniformly resized but may not be redrawn, rotated, recolored, distorted, or otherwise altered.

The tilted "r" in alternate logos is deliberately transparent so that it can match the background color. Do not fill in the "r" with a different color.

Do not display logos against a textured background.

* [Primary logo](/assets/images/logo/ruqqus_logo_square_white_fill.png)
* [Alternate logo](/assets/images/logo/ruqqus_logo_white.png)
* [Primary logo with wordmark](/assets/images/logo/ruqqus_text_logo.png)
* [Alternate logo with wordmark](/assets/images/logo/ruqqus_text_logo_white.png)

## Mascot

The name of the Drama mascot is "Ruqqie".

Ruqqie may be resized, but should not be redrawn, rotated, distorted, or otherwise altered. Transformative artistic works are permitted under Fair Use. However, Ruqqie and transformative artistic works based on Ruqqie may not be sold, affixed to merchandise, or otherwise monetized without explicit written permission from Drama LLC.

## Terminology

Drama is broken into numerous smaller messaging and commenting boards focused around a variety of topics. These boards are called "Guilds". Guild names always start with a `+` symbol, and are usually (though not always) named after their topic of interest. For example, [+news](/+news) is a Guild focused on sharing and discussion of news and current events.

The users who create and moderate Guilds are called "Guildmasters". Guildmasters are regular users, and have no affiliation with Drama LLC beyond having a rdrama.net account.

Users can submit posts to Guilds. They can also can add comments as replies to posts or other comments.

Guildmasters cannot hide or remove content. They can "kick" off-topic posts out of their guild. Such content then appears in [+general](/+general), an unmoderated Guild that functions as a catch-all area. Similarly, Guildmasters can "yank" content from +general into their own guild. When a post is kicked or yanked, all of its comments move with it. 

When referring to the Drama social media platform, use "Drama" or "rdrama.net".

When referring to the business which owns and operates the Drama platform, use "Drama LLC".

When referring to the owners, staff, or other elements of Drama LLC, use "Drama staff", "Drama owners", or similar phrasing.

Users of the Drama platform may be informally called "Ruqqies", or formally "Drama users".

## Coloring

The name of the Drama purple color is "porpl". Its RGB hex code is #FF66AC.
